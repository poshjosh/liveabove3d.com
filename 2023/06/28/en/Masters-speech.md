**<u>MASTERS SPEECH FOR SERVANTS</u>**

**While being evicted from my apartment.**

***Neighbor:*** (in panic) They’re throwing your belongings onto the
street!

***Me:*** (watching Passion of the Christ) The same hands that threw
them out will carry them in.

At the onset, it is important that Christians respond to lies like
these.

Such responses eventually make us conscious of which words enter our
hearts.

--- stopped here ---

**After watching Lori, a Christian, cry in despair because of damning
news from her doctor.**

***Here is what I told Lori:*** “Those who saw you cry today, will no
doubt see you rejoice, after the Lord has healed you”.

**While receiving test results from a doctor**

***Doctor:*** You have 9 months to live.

***Me:*** I will live to glorify God, love after you have died.

**While casting out an evil spirit.**

***Evil spirit:*** I am so and so.. I have so and so etc

***Me:*** Can the children of lies speak anything meaningful to the
children of Truth?  
  
***Evil spirit:*** I will destroy you. I will destroy this church. I
will destroy your family.

***Me:*** If your master could not destroy Christ, how then can you
destroy the one in Christ.

**They plan to fire you. You meet the manager who must make the deadly
decision.**

***Manager:*** (trying to look calm) How are you doing?

***Me:*** (with a warm smile) I am doing fine; but you? What you have
planned to do, do quickly.

*Inspiration from John 13:21-27*

The shining of light, retreats darkness.

For whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his
tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit;**<sup> </sup>**let
him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue
it. **<sup> </sup>**For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and
his ears are open to their prayer.
