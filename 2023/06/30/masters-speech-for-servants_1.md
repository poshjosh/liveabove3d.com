Hello and welcome to Live Above 3D.

Today we begin a series called: Master’s Speech for Servants.

This new series will counter fear and build your faith.

Be blessed as you follow in Jesus’ name.

During the days of Paul, Asia enjoyed the blessings of the word of God.

“all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus”

Acts 19:10

“God wrought special miracles through Paul”

Acts 19:11

“and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.”

Acts 19:17B

“so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.”

Acts 19:20

Parts of the world do not enjoy the blessings of God’s word.

Those parts of the world are full of information from all other sources.

Romans 3 verse 4 says: Let God be true, but every man a liar.

This means that words which do not come from God, are lies.

Lies may not seem obvious to the undiscerning eye.

However, we know that: faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of
God.

Romans 10:17

So, any word that does not bring faith is not of God; and brings fear.

Fear constricts (blocks) the free gifts; the supply; the grace of God.

If we do nothing, when words from other sources come our way, fear takes
root.

Yet we often do nothing, because fear seems harmless.

Fear is not harmless. It prevents us from receiving God’s blessings.

No wonder it is written: “without faith it is impossible to please God”

Hebrews 11:6

We ought to keep lies and fear from our heart.

This is why it is written: “keep your heart with all diligence, for out
of it are the issues of life”

Proverbs 4:23

Lies are kept from our heart when we respond to the lies with the truth.

“Master’s Speech for Servants” is about faith filled responses to fear.

Today we publish one such example.

**While being evicted from my apartment.**

***Neighbor:*** (in panic) They’re throwing your belongings onto the
street!

***Me:*** (watching Passion of the Christ) The same hands that threw
them out will carry them in.
