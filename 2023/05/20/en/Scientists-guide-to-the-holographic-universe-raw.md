The bible proves that this reality is a hologram.

What scientists call the fourth dimension is what some religions call
the realm of the spirit.

The bible names places in this realms and tells Christians to be
spiritually minded.

One of the major questions raised when considering the possibility of
the spirit realm is whether there is life after death.

Many scientists in the hard sciences do not believe there is life after
death. However, many psychiatrists and psychologists do.

The bible talks about the things on earth being a shadow of things in
the heaven.

Dear Scientist

I know that by now you reasonably suspect that we live in a holographic
universe.

That you are just arriving at this conclusion befuddles me.

Especially when the bible clearly states that this reality is a shadow
of some other. (Please take note of the word shadow).

I know you do not care much about what the bible says.

However, since it noted that our universe is holographic, long before
mankind could imagine this, you should at least take a cue (or 2) from
it.

Here are some cues about our holographic universe as noted by the bible:

The bible lets us know that this universe is a shadow of some other
reality.

Take note of the word shadow.

Feel free to use this information to arrive at some stellar discovery

Also feel free to not give credit to the author of the Bible.

1.  Lower dimensionals are shadows of higher dimensionals.

2.  Light casts shadows

3\. Words are light.

Here is some information about the real universe from the Bible:

1.  Time is not as we know it in this universe – Jesus captured this
    clearly when He said: “before Abraham was, I am”

What out God knowing the end from the beginning and a thousand days as
one day to God.

All these

Spaceless

Decayless – Mathew 6:19-21

Hebrews

temporal earthly temple was merely a *shadow* of the eternal heavenly
temple

Things materialize from their true substance.

Hebrews 11:1

Faith is the substance of things which have not yet materialized.

Things have a substance. The reality of things is faith.

the Catholic priest, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, once said, “We are not
human beings having a spiritual experience. We are *spiritual beings
having a human experience*.”

Since the creator has to be more real than his creation.
