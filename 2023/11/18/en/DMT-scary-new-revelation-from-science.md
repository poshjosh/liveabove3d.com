There's a scary new revelation from science, and its not what you think.

**Hello, and welcome to: Live Above 3D.**

How would aliens contact us?

Well, scientists have been listening for radio signals from aliens for
decades.

The universe is so large that, if the earth represented the universe,
then a 1-hour flight represents 2 billion light years of travel.

It seems like this kind of journey was never meant to be made, even by
radio signals.

Yet there is another way.

Theoretically, if you move to a dimension where there is no time, then
billions of years would pass in zero seconds.

One other way is to use entanglement.

Quantum entanglement is when the properties of one particle are linked
to those of another, even over vast distances.

Simply put, entangled particles could be used to communicate over
inter-galactic distances.

This is possible, even though scientists swear that there is no transfer
of information between entangled particles.

Extra-dimensional travel and entanglement make it possible for humans to
be contacted by other worldly beings.

How would this work?

Many believe that the human spirit can exist beyond the physical.

That is another way of saying that the human spirit is
extra-terrestrial.

In Part 2 of the video: “If God exists, where is they”; we showed how
humankind lost its extra-terrestrial ability.

Now research by the University of Greenwich and the Imperial College
London into DMTs seem to be un-locking our extra-terrestrial ability.

DMTs are a psychedelic (a kind of drug) capable of producing radical
shifts in conscious experience.

Research has many users of DMT experiencing other worldly beings.

According to one: “DMT hurls the user into a bizarre hyperdimensional
world full of extremely intelligent entities”.

We may be in contact with other worldly beings; yet there is a catch.

We have invested so much emotion, time and effort believing and pursuing
contact with aliens over 3-dimensional space and time.

This means that we may resist any idea contrary to our investments.

Yet the evidence is beginning to tilt in favor of extra-dimensions and
extra-terrestrial communication.

Hmmm.

Dear scientist, take that bold step and rethink.

**Thanks for listening.**

**Love us, hate us, like us, follow us; do it now.**
