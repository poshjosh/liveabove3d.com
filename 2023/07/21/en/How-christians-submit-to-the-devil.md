**<u>HOW CHRISTIANS SUBMIT TO THE DEVIL</u>**

Hello and welcome to Live Above 3D.

Today, we will show you how not to submit to the Devil.

Submission is not always obvious.

Adam submitted to the devil, but this was not obvious from the story in
Genesis.

Romans 6:16 says: “You are slaves to the one you obey”.

Adam knew he was being freed from God’s influence, but he did not know
that by the same token, he was being submitted to the devils.

Satan’s power comes from his influence over the world.

This is why in Ephesians 2:2 Satan is called: “the prince of the power
of the air”.

Here are 2 situations when Christians may un-intentionally submit to the
devil’s influence.

One

**When we read fortune cookies.**

Don’t read fortune cookies.

It seems harmless because there is no evil looking fortune teller behind
the words from the cookie.

However, those fortune cookie words, may have more influence on a
Christian than on a person who never takes words seriously.

Each time you find yourself with a fortune cookie, rather than open it,
open your heart, and announce the best life you would like to live.

While your friends read out what their fortune cookies revealed, speak
out that best life that you have decided for yourself.

Be ready! If your friends are wrongly inspired, they may suspect you and
try to see proof that the fortune cookie really revealed what you said.

Two

**When we receive the doctor’s report.**

The doctor is not the enemy.

On the other hand, the doctor’s report, to the extent that it disagrees
with God’s Word is the enemy.

Always prepare your response, before you receive the doctor’s report.

For example, if the doctor says: “You have stage 4 cancer.”

You could answer: “I will have none of that.” Thereafter, quote the
relevant scripture you have prepared.

The doctor believed in their report, that they announced it to you with
authority, seriousness, and a sense of finality.

You also, believe in the report of the bible and announce it with utmost
authority, seriousness, and finality.

We have a series on what to answer in various situations.

The series is called: “Master’s Speech for Servants”
