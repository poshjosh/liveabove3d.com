**Hello and, Welcome to: Live Above 3D**

Today, I will let you in on why God created hell

There is a life that sustains other life.

This kind of life is called Zoe. It is the life of God.

Zoe sustains other life by constantly renewing it, by automatically
eliminating corruption.

Some physical substances have the characteristics of Zoe. For example:
fire.

Fire burns things that cannot stand the test of time, that is:
impurities.

On the other hand, fire purifies substances like gold.

Another example is white blood cells, which destroy diseased cells in
our body.

In the spiritual, corruption or impurities cannot survive the presence
of Zoe. Hence, the bible records that the consequence of corruption or
sin is death.

This death is a spiritual death; that is, to be cut off from Zoe.

Hmmm.

Why destroy or cut-off anything at all?

Notice how we are indirectly asking the question: why is there a hell?

This is because hell is where impurities, imperfections are destroyed,
burned, cut-off.

So why cut off corruption or impurity?

Impurity, like entropy will continue to increase till it consumes the
whole of existence.

Protecting existence from this fate requires constant purification.

Constant purification entails identifying impurities, separating and
destroying it.

Thereâ€™s more.

God is love. To Them, everything that is contrary to love is impure.

We mean everything that has to do with hate. For example: fear, anger
and un-forgiveness.

This means the beings that enter hell are un-repentantly fearful, angry
and unforgiving.

You see, the torture in hell is a consequence of the type of beings
present there.

Likewise, after judgement day, the love and peace everywhere else will
be a consequence of the absence of hellish beings.

From today till judgement day, are days of identifying and separating
corruption as well as impurity.

Preaching the message of Christ is about inviting people to submit to
the correcting influence of their creator over time.

It is this group of people who can live for eternity without impurity
consuming the entire universe.

Shalom.
