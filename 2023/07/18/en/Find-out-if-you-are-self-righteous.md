Hello and welcome to Live Above 3D

Today, we will test if we are self-righteous. Thereafter we will reset
our hearts onto the righteousness of God.

Many agree that our righteousness is of faith.

Unfortunately, we often subconsciously try to live by the law.

For example, I once found myself asking God to bless me since I had paid
my tithes and offerings regularly.

Under the grace of Jesus Christ, I should not pay my tithe and offering
to get blessed.

Rather I should be propelled by the love of God; And we know that the
evidence of this kind of love is sacrificial giving.

You see, it is easy to mistake our righteousness for that of God.

A simple way to distinguish between the two is this: “anything that
depends on you is self-righteousness”.

On the other hand: “anything that depends on God is true righteousness”.

Based on this understanding, we have created our test for
self-righteousness.

If you feel uncomfortable saying any of the following statements, then
you are self-righteous.

One

I overcome the world.

Two

I am joint heirs with Christ.

Three

A greater than Solomon, am I.

If you feel uncomfortable saying any of the above 3 statements. Then it
is highly likely that you are depending on your righteousness.

Suppress your righteousness by repeating the following statements and
then try again.

One

Let God be true but every man a liar.

Two

If my heart condemns me, God is greater than my heart and knows all
things.

Now go ahead and re-try the test for self-righteousness.

Do this often to reset your heart in truth, that is in Christ Jesus.

Thanks for listening.

Love us, hate us, like us, follow us; do it now.
