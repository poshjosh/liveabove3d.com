If you wanted to take over the world today, which 3 nations would you
uproot?

**Hello, and welcome to: Live Above 3D (<live.above.3d@gmail.com>)**

The bible records that the roman empire will be revived on 3 other
nations being uprooted.

Which 3 nations do you think could be uprooted?

The word uproot is quite powerful, and I believe it suggests swift or
sweeping defeat.

Today, such sweeping defeat, especially against another developed or
determined nation, is quite difficult without nuclear weapons.

Nine countries have nuclear weapons.

Israel is one of the nine countries. Of the remaining eight:

Four nuclear powers are pro-Israel namely: United States, United
Kingdom, France and India.

Four nuclear powers are anti-Israel namely: Russia, China, Pakistan and
North Korea.

One of the remaining 5 nuclear powers will likely uproot 3 pro-Israel
nations, to revive the roman empire.

man, and a mouth speaking great things.
