What would make your brothers think that slavery is mild punishment for
you?

**Hello, and welcome to: Live Above 3D.
(**<live.above.3d@gmail.com>**)**

Do you know that Joseph’s brothers thought that slavery was mild
punishment for him?

Joseph had a dream that his parents and brothers would bow to him.

But that’s not the reason his brothers tried to kill him, then settled
for slavery.

You see, no one tried to kill Abraham, even though, like Joseph, he had
a promise from God.

As for Joseph, since he was the 11th of 12 sons, his dream made his
older brothers feel that God rejected them to choose Joseph.

This rejection haunted Joseph’s siblings to the point that they thought:
“You know what, let’s kill him so that his dream will not come true.”

What has this got to do with hatred for Jews?

Well, if Jews are a promised people, then those who feel excluded from
the promise, will do everything possible to disprove the promise.

Here’s the catch.

When God chooses another person and you try to undermine God’s choice,
you are confirming the reason why He did not choose you in the first
place.
