Hello, and welcome to: Live Above 3D.

Today I will expose the plan to create a third Adam, representing a new
lineage of humans.

In Genesis, a lineage was established; whose patriarch was Adam.

About four thousand years later, another lineage was established; whose
patriarch is Jesus Christ.

In 1 Corinthians 15:45 the bible calls Jesus Christ the last Adam.

Notwithstanding the bible’s choice of words, in the coming years, a new
lineage will be established.

The new lineage will attempt to improve our current imperfections.

We call the patriarch of this new lineage the would-be third Adam.

Today we compare the first Adam to the would-be third Adam.

In Genesis 1:27, God created the first Adam in his own image.

Similarly, Revelation 13:14 says: “the beast deceives them that dwell on
the earth, that they should make an image to the beast.”

Genesis 2:7 says: “the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”

Similarly, Revelation 13:15 says: “the beast had power to give life unto
the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should speak.”

Genesis 1:28 says: “God said unto them, subdue the earth: and have
dominion over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”

Likewise, in Revelation 13:15, the beast enforces dominion by killing
those who refuse to worship it.

Finally, Genesis 1:28 says: “God said unto them, be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth.”

Similarly, in Revelation 13 from verse 16 to 18, the lineage of the
would-be third Adam will be forcibly spread all over the earth through a
mark.

Here is how the bible put it:

And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,
to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Revelation 13 verse 18: “Let him that hath understanding count the
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man;”

…and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

**Thanks for listening.**

**Love us, hate us, like us, follow us; do it now.**

**<u>Bible Verses</u>**

…God created man in his own image…

Genesis 1:27

…the first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a
quickening spirit.

1 Corinthians 15:45

…he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image
of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not
worship the image of the beast should be killed.

Revelation 13:15
