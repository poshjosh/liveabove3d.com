It is 2009 and you want to create the first (and soon-to-be most popular) to-do app.

Your best friend informs you that the app will also increase the productivity of horrible people – including serial killers.

Do you stop developing the app?

Similarly, would you refuse free will for all humans because some humans would be evil?

Hmm

What if we made humans immune to the challenges brought about by evil?

Then we could still have free will.

You see, rather than avoid challenges, God uses challenges to His advantage.

Through Christ, God solved the problem of evil and all the suffering it brings.

Some are already living the solution.

Others reject the solution, yet turn around and ask: “If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?”

They ignore the fact that avoiding trouble is weakness.

Using troubles to your advantage is mastery.
