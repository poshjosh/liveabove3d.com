What can I say about Joy?

Is it the laughter that pricks us, time and again?

Or the inner feeling of contentment,

settled upon barren land like a pond,

that ebbs and flows with season?

Or a river that will always overflow its bank?

Hmm.

Strange phenomenon indeed,

that will make you cry, laugh and moan.

That you all at once know.

Aha then!

Excitement is like rain on dry land.

Enough of it and a puddle of happiness ensues.

As for joy, it is a regenerating spring that serves life.
