If Jesus is God, who did he pray to?
Once we are done, you will never ask that question again.
There is a better question, and it will surprise you.
Hmmm.
The key is to look for the question - behind the question.
In this case, the question behind the question is:
Can God be at 2 places at the same time?
If God can be at 2 places at the same time, 
can each one of the 2 persons of God, move independent of the other?
Take a minute to think about it.
Any being that can be in 2 independent places at the same time, can have one of its persons talk to the other.
If one of 2 God persons can talk to the other, then one of 2 God persons can pray to the other.
So, never ask that question again.
Rather ask if God can be at 2 places at the same time.
Shalom.
