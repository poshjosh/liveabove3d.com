What has living and dead planets, got to do with Christianity?
The answer we reveal at the end - you have never heard before.
---
There are burning and there are shining lights.
The sun creates light and shines to others – it is a burning light.
The moon reflects the light of the sun – it is a shining (but not a burning) light.
God is the father of lights.
One such light is Lucifer, whose name means light bearer. 
Lucifer, like the moon, used to reflect the light of God; but now reflects his own light.
Another such light is Adam.
Adam, like the moon, used to reflect the light of God, but later the light of Lucifer.
Another such light is Jesus - the Christ.
Jesus, like the sun, has burns the light of God from within.
What about humans? What about Christians?
Humans are like Adam, reflecting Lucifer’s light, 
After we believe Jesus, the Holy Spirit lights a fire in our core, so that we can support life - like the earth.
All life supporting planets, carry the fire of Yahweh in their bellies.
Shalom.
