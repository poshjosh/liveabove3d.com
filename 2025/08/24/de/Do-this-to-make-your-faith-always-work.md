The top cancer specialist declares that your wife will die.

In faith, you declare that she will live to glorify God.

Faith is evidence.

Do you know that evidence is required only when the truth is being challenged.

No one needs evidence that 1 plus 1 is 2, in court.

In your case, evidence is required because 99.9 percent of the time,

when the top specialist says that you are going to die - you will die.

If you are blessed enough to find evidence that your wife will live,

go to court and make your case.

It’s a spiritual court, so make your case in your heart, by brooding on the evidence.

A person brooding would be seen contending - talking to themselves.

At every turn repeat the evidence to counter thoughts of death.

Here’s the important part.

Brood until you begin to subconsciously blurt out the contents of your heart.

Those words from the heart are like the roar of a lion.

Whatever you roar; will surely come to pass.
