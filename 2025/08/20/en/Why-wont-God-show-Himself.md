Why won’t God show Himself?

Let’s see.

Imagine that God showed himself today.
Either in a big way - fire and a voice from the sky,
Or in a loving way - a man, teaching, healing and more.
What will happen when our generation passes?
Future generations would not believe whatever we write about God.
God would have to show himself to every new generation.
There is a problem, but it is not “God showing himself”.
The true problem is death.
If there was no death, the times that God showed Himself would be enough.
Jesus came to solve the problem of death by, giving humans the life of God, which does not die.
All who believe Jesus will have accepted everlasting life.
Now the shocking part.
When we receive the life of God, we become the evidence of God to others, by teaching, healing and more.
If you are sincere about God showing Himself, you should accept Jesus. 

Share with someone who doubts that God exists.
