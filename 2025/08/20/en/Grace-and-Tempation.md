Do you Believe in Grace in Jesus Christian, but still struggle to make things work?
here is something for you.
you pray for something.
after a while, Nothing Seems to have changed.
You Begin to imagine that there is something you need to do before God Answers.
When that Happens,
Even Though you are under grace (Becaus the Grace of God is freely available to you);
You are not walking in Grace (Because you Believe in your working to get what you pray for).
You need to walk in Grace, Through Faith.
You can do this by Uprooting Every Imagination that Takes the Place of God’s Truth.
in this case, God’s truth is that he gives freely to anyone who asks in faith.
The Process of Uprooting Imaginations and Planting God’s Truth is Called: “The Good Fight of Faith”.
One Last Thing.
Shortly after God Called Jesus “his Beloved Son”, Satan Tempted Jesus by Saying “If You are the Son of God Turn This Stone Into Bread”
Tempation is When You Imagine That You Need To Was Freely Given.
