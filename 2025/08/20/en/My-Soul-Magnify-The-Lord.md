When you want to raise the dead to life - sing this song:

My spirit magnify the lord.
My Soul Praise his name.
For Death Could not Hold Him Captive.
Even in the grave, Jesus is lord
for death could not hold Him captive.
Even in the grave, Jesus is lord

and Mary Said: "My soul glorifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in God My Saviour " - Luke 1: 46-47.

WHOM GOD HATH RAISED UP, HAVING LOOSED THE PAINS OF DEATH: Because it was not possible that he should be holds of it. - Act 2:24
