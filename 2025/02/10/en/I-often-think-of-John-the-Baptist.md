I often think about John the Baptist.

He was the most righteous and holy of his time.

In fact, Jesus said:

“I assure you that there is none born of woman who is greater than John the Baptist”.

Then king Herod Antipas went for John’s head.

John the Baptist knew, Jesus knew, heaven knew – yet John was beheaded.

Quite worrisome to think of.

Compare that to what happened years later, after Jesus gained authority and tasked the church to use it.

This time King Herod Agrippa (another member of the Herodian family) went for Peter’s head.

Peter knew, heaven knew, the Holy Spirit knew.

While Peter was in prison, waiting to be killed; the church prayed fervently.

Peter was saved.

Here’s the lesson.

Jesus has done his part and handed over authority (greater than that of all the Old Testament prophets) to you.

It is written: To whom much is given, much is expected.

You, my friend - are responsible for making sure evil does not thrive.

Shalom.


BIBLE VERSES

Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist! Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force. - Matthew 11:11 – 12

And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to keep all that I commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” – Matthew 28:18-20.

but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a beating, will receive but a few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more. – Luke 12:48
