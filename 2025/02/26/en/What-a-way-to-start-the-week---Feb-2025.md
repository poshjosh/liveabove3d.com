Dear Holy Spirit, I know that you help the weak.

You show them how to trust you.

You make them great, despite their weakness.

I rejoice for it’s my turn.

Use your strength on me, Holy Spirit.

Thank you - in Jesus name.

Because of Jesus.

This week, principalities make way for your blessing.

The Lord rebuke them, for your sake.

This week, the first light of blessing reaches your face.

In Jesus name.

SONG TITLED: HALLOWETH BE YOU NAME - BY ELI J

Verse

With open hands we say. 
Halloweth be your name.

Whatever comes our way.
Halloweth be your name.

The one who is to come.
We lift our voices and say.
Halloweth be your name. 

The beginning and the end.
We lift our voices and say.
Halloweth be your name. 

Chorus

Jesus, Jesus, you never failed me.
You are just the same.
Yesterday, today.
Look at me, look at me.
The one you saved.
Halloweth be your name. 

Jesus, Jesus, you never failed me.
You are just the same.
Yesterday, today.
Look at me, look at me.
The one you saved.
Halloweth be your name.
