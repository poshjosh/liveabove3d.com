The only religion in the world where a person’s God comes and lives inside of them.

Hmmm.

A Chinese scholar was given a copy of the New Testament.

He had read the sacred books from other popular religions.

After reading the New Testament, the scholar was asked:

“What was the most amazing thing?”

It was thought that the man would say:

“The most amazing thing I read is that Jesus was born of a virgin”

Or “That Jesus died and physically rose again from the dead”.

Instead of those, the scholar said that the most awesome thing about Christianity is in Ephesians Chapter 2 which says:

“In times past, you walked according to the course of this world”

“According to the prince of the power of the air”

And at the end of that same Chapter, it says:

“You are the habitation of God”

The scholar asked “Sir, does your God live inside of you?”

I say yes.

What do you think, dear Jew, Muslim, Hindu, other religion?

The above story demonstrates one striking difference between Christianity and other religions of the world.


BIBLE VERSE

in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. - Ephesians 2:22 (LSB)


His body, which is the church. - Colossians 1:24 (LSB)

carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints (or holy ones), to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 

Colossians 1:25b – 27
