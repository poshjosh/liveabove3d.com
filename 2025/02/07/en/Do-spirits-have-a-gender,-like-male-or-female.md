Is God male or female? - wait, is he both? – or something else?

Hmmm.

In Genesis 1 Verse 26 God said:

Let us make man look and act like us.

That was before Eve was created.

Remember that Eve was later created from Adam.

This means that at the time God spoke about creating man, Eve was still a part of Adam.

That person, which contained both Adam and Eve - is the image of God.

So, whether male or female – we are all God-kinds – a race of gods.

That my friends, is a revelation we should live by.

Shalom.
