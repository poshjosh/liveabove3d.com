Dear Atheist,

Do you think you know the God of the bible?

Well, no article, religious book or person can teach you about YaHWeH.

They can guide you to YaHWeH, but you must enter YaHWeH yourself.

Forget the religious debates – this is what YaHWeH wants:

An everlasting kingdom without war, struggle or tears.

This is only possible if the subjects love one another.

To show that you can live forever in love, you need to let love guide you - today.

How does this work - you say?

Well, the love of a creator (to a sickly creation) is to heal that creation.

So, YaHWeH came to earth as a man and healed the sick, cast out devils, delivered the oppressed and much more.

YaHWeH is now inviting everyone, who wants to be guided by love, to do the same thing he did while he was on earth.

Rather than complain of evil, use YaHWeH’s power to heal the world of evil.

Is that a bad offer?

If not - why reject it?

Shalom.
