Most Christians think the spirit realm is some fluffy, airy, imaginary or semi-real place.

Wrong! Very wrong – in fact pitifully wrong.

You’ll be shocked to find out what we have to say about the spirit realm and the fourth dimension.

It’s not what you think – so stick around to find out.

Here we go.

“The more solid thing can pass through the less solid thing”.

For example, you can pass through air.

You can pass through air, because you are more solid than air.

Think about that for a moment.

“The more solid thing can pass through the less solid thing”.

Spirits can walk through walls.

This means that spirits are more solid than the physical world.

Has it begun to make sense?

Never forget - the spirit realm is more real than the world you see.

In theory, scientists say the fourth dimension is more real than the third dimension we live in.

We can now put two and two together to agree, that the fourth dimension, is the spirit realm.

Doctor David Yong-Gi Cho, pastor and best-selling author, wrote at least 2 books about this.

One - the Fourth Dimension: Discovering A New World of Answered Prayer.

Two - Fourth Dimensional Living in a 3-Dimensional World.

We recommend you read those books; but continue watching – there’s a more important point.

Why can’t we see this (more real) world?

Well, when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden, they began to see more of the physical and less of the spiritual.

Since then, each time a human faces some trouble, that human must choose between the spiritual and the physical solution.

Over thousands of years, humans have repeatedly chosen the physical over the spiritual solution.

This has made our brains grow bigger, but our spirits blind, deaf and worse.

This is the case, even though the spiritual is more important than, and gives birth to, the physical.

Hmmm.

What are you going to do about this?

Before you answer, here’s another question.

Between a billion dollars and getting to know the creator of all realms – which would you choose?

Once again, you don’t need to answer, because you make that choice each day – by the way you live.

Do you really want to change things?

Then do less to survive or succeed and do more to know Yahweh Adonai.

Also, follow us to stay challenged.

Two of the most important decisions of your life.

Shalom.
