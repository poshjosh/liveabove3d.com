You lost your job.

You pray fervently about this.

Well, you may be doing the right thing – only for the wrong reason.

Stay with me.

Hmmm.

In Genesis 1:26, God created humans in his image. In Chapter 3, the serpent told Eve that she could be like God.

Here’s the thing - never try to get what God has already given you.

In Matthew 3:17, God called Jesus his beloved son. In the next chapter, the tempter told Jesus: “If you are the son of God”

Has it begun to make sense?

God is responsible for your health and wealth.

All you need to do is believe God.

You can’t believe God if you are concerned for your health and wealth.

Here you are thinking that temptation only has to do with the urge to do evil.

Whereas you respond in fear to distractions thrown your way by the adversary.

Distractions that make you concerned about your health and wealth. 

You see, when you pray for what God has already given you, you have fallen into temptation.

Never forget that.

So, how should you pray (even when you just lost your job)?

Pray fervently with loud cries and tears that the Holy Spirit should help your weakness.

Weakness is focusing on the problem, not Christ - the solution.

Then pray for the church, spiritual leaders, political leaders; pray for specific people you know who need help.

That my friend – is Christianity.
