Faith is a currency.

Many have heard this, but don’t understand how that currency works, in real life.

Faith is a currency - the world does not want you to have.

Hmmm.

Currencies are usually backed by something.

In the past, most world currencies were backed by gold.

Spiritual currency, that is – faith – is backed by emotion.

Remember, faith works through love (which is an emotion).

Stay with me for a bit.

Today’s world is designed to make you respond.

To make you angry.

To make you hate nationalists, or liberals, or republicans, or democrats.

To make you hate women, or men, or immigrants, or more.

What you should know is that your response, drains your emotion.

Emotion which is important for spiritual power.

Hmmm.

When you see a person heal the sick or cast our devils.

That person has learned to channel their emotion.

As did Jesus, of whom it is written:

“During Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears” – Hebrews 5:7.

You see, Jesus cried for the right reasons, at the right time.

However, today – we are tricked into releasing our emotion.

How? You may ask.

Well, misfortune is presented as comedy.

Hate is packaged as passion.

Once it hits you; you respond.

So, what should you do?

Decrease social media and other sources of information, and increase the bible.

Do it now.

Shalom.
