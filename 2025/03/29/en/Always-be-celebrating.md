King Solomon told us to guard our hearts diligently.

So, I preached that we should watch what enters our heart – what we think about.

You will hear many preach such, but –

The next day the Holy Spirit showed me how to guard my heart.

You’ll be shocked, so stick around till the end.

Philippians Chapter 4 from Verse 4 to 7.

Always be celebrating in the Lord.

Let your mindful spirit be known to everyone. 

Don’t worry about anything.

Rather than worry, pray with thankfulness in your heart.

When you do all those, here’s what will happen.

God’s peace will - guard your hearts, and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Now I ask 

Are you always celebrating?

Does everyone know you to be thoughtful?

Are you always grateful?

Do you prophesy instead of complaining?

Today, you have learnt what to do.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSE

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! Let your considerate spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. – Philippians 4:4-7ist Jesus. – Philippians 4:4-7
