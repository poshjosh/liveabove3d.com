Masturbator in heaven?

You’ll be surprised – In fact the last sentence in this video will shock you.

Hmmn.

Always answer self-righteousness with more righteousness.

For example, when asked: “Do you mean that a thief or a masturbator could go to heaven?”

Answer the following:

You say that stealing is a sin.

I tell you, even witnessing theft and doing nothing is a sin.

If you know a thieving leader and you do not speak up for fear, then you are cowardly.

Is it not written that the destiny of the cowardly is the lake burning with fire and Sulphur?

You say that masturbation is a sin.

I tell you, even seeing part of a woman’s breast is a sin.

How then shall you escape sin, unless you pluck out your eyes.

This is the reason for the gospel: “that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.”

You have heard it said: “repent of your sin.”

Today, I tell you: “repent of your righteousness”.

BIBLE VERSES

But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and sexually immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. – Revelation 21:8 (LSB)

But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. – Matthew 5:28-19 (LSB)

He saved us, not by works which we did in righteousness, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit. - Titus 3:5 (LSB)

nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified. - Galatians 2:16 (LSB)
