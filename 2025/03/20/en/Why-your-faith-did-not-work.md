Why did faith not work for me?

Hmmm.

Faith works by love.

Are you using faith for your own self?

God cannot take care of you, while you are taking care of yourself.

Those who know that God will take care of them, use their faith to take care of others.

Never forget.

Faith works by love.

BIBLE VERSE

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love. â€“ Galatians 5:6
