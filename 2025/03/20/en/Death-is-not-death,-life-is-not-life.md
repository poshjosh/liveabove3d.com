Death is not death

The bible says that anyone who believes in Jesus shall not die.

Yet we know that Christians have been dying all this while.

Well, the bible makes it clear that the death of the body is not the death we should care for.

There is another death after that, from which there is no return.

That is the death those who believe in Jesus will never taste.

There’s more.

Life is not life.

Speaking to living humans, Jesus said:

“I came so that you may have life”.

Yet we know that those Jesus was speaking to were alive.

Well, the bible makes it clear that the life of the body is not the life we should care for.

There is another life greater than that, of which there is no blame, no ageing, no decrease.

This is the life those who believe in Jesus have already received.

You already have the life of Yahweh.
