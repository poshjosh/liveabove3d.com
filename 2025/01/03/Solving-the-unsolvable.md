So, you messed up.

You got yourself in big trouble.

A mob boss is after you.

Or is it the law the pursues you?

Or some spiritual problem - which has refused to end.

You tried your best to solve this problem.

You are exhausted.

Hmmm.

Here is hope - what God is saying to you:

"Can the prey be taken from the mighty?"

"Can the lawfully captured be freed?"

God is saying: "Even those captured by the mighty will be taken away,"

"And the prey of the tyrant will be freed."

"For I will contend with the one who contends with you."

"And I will save your children."

Isaiah Chapter 49 Verses 24 and 25.

Shalom
