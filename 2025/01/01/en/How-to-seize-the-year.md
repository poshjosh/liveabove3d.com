There are plans

To make you anxious

To make you angry

To make you hateful

"Never be anxious,

Rather pray and ask

God; with thanksgiving"

Philippians 4:6

Rather than struggle,

Stay still - watch

the Lord fight for you.

Exodus 14:14

As you watch, distractions will increase;

Be patient!

"In your patience, possess your soul"

Luke 21:19

Shalom


BIBLE VERSES

He who is slow to anger
is better than the mighty,
And he who rules his own spirit
than he who captures a city.

Proverbs 16:32
