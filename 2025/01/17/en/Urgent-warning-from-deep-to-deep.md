Do you know that fourth dimension beings (or spirits), are not permitted, to interact with humans?

This is for the safety of humans - however, some spirits disobey.

It’s not what you are thinking - so stick around till the end, to find out.

John 10 from Verse 1, put it this way:

Anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the door is a thief.

Anyone who enters by the door is a shepherd, to which the doorkeeper opens.

Here’s where it gets interesting.

The door into humanity - is to be born as a child.

Guess which fourth dimension being was born as a child.

Jesus - the Christ. 

Guess which fourth dimension being entered humanity through another means.

Lucifer - the deceiver.

Genesis 3 from Verse 1 records how the serpent deceived the first humans.

Revelation 12:9 and Revelation 20:2, call Lucifer: that serpent of old.

Hmmm.

Any gods, spirits or aliens you are in contact with - will deceive, use and abuse you.

Shalom.


BIBLE VERSES

“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. 2 But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep. 3 To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When he brings all his own out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5 A stranger they will never follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”

John 10:1-5
