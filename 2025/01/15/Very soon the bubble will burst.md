Dear atheist

Over the coming years, humans will be gradually exposed to non-human realities.

The exact same thing various religions have been saying exist.

When that happens, you (being an atheist, will believe), because the exposure will come from trusted sources, like government and scientists.

Here is what you need to know.

That exposure will be forced, because the single most catastrophic foretold event would be about to happen.

The mass exodus of those who believe in Jesus.

I know you don’t believe in God, but bear with me a little – you need to hear this.

Notice that I did not say: exodus of Christians. 

Think about it.

Millions from all ethnicities and religions, will disappear from the earth.

When that happens, here is the question you should ask yourself:

Do you want to trust the leaders of this world?

Or do you want to trust Jesus, who died for you and whose only commandment is love?

Make the right choice.

The single most important choice of your life.
