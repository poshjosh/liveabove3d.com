Dear Christian,

The rapture is the second exodus.

Joseph was betrayed, yet he went ahead to prepare a place for his family.

Likewise, Jesus was betrayed, yet he went ahead to prepare a place for us.

There were times of trouble in Egypt before the exodus.

Likewise, there will be times of trouble on earth before the rapture.

The sea parted for the Israelites to pass through.

Likewise, will the heavens part for us to pass through.

Before the exodus the Egyptian pharaohs had been in contact with gods.

Today, a few humans have been in contact with alien gods.

Before the exodus the Egyptians achieved a lot by the power of the gods.

Today, humans have achieved a lot by the power of alien gods.

Before the exodus, the Egyptian pharaohs, backed by their gods, contested against Moses, the prophet of Yahweh.

Soon, all our scientific achievements, mixed with some spiritual boost will, try to contest against Jesus.

The day of the Lord is at hand!

Shalom
