What language do spirits speak?

Wrong question.

That question is thinking of communication the way humans do it.

However, there is a God kind of communication.

God says that anyone joined to Christ is one spirit.

God also says that such a person has the mind of Christ.

What does that mean?

Entanglement – That’s what it means.

Science has repeatedly shown that 2 entangled particles, can act in unity, even when there is total silence and a great distance, between them.

Hmmm.

So, God communicates with you; you perceive what he wants you to do – and do it.

Then one day – silence.

The days of silence are the days of testing how entangled you are with God.

With no communication from God, you are expected to know what God would do – and do it.

That my friend – is spiritual entanglement.


Bible Verses

The one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
1 Corinthians 6:17

For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will direct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1 Corinthians 2:16
