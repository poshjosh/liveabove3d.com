You are told that a large army is approaching your village.

However, you reply: “I need proof of the army before I believe”.

You are then told that all you need to do, is climb up the mountain, to see the army.

You refuse.

Yet, if what they say is true, the army will change the course of humanity – forever.

Hmmm.

As the army gets closer the ground begins to vibrate to its marching.

You say that there are other explanations for this vibration.

I agree - mostly.

Many hear vibrations when there is none, others stage fake vibrations to get attention.

Yet, here is what I am saying.

Climb, the, mountain!

There is a spirit realm, which every human can access.

Accessing that realm does not require faith.

You need to search that realm for the truth about what is about to befall the earth, and whose side you should be on.

The single most important journey of your life.
