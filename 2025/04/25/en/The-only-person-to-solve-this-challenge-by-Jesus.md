Only one person will solve this challenge by Jesus.

You’ll be shocked, so stick around to find out.

Jesus could have said: I will show you how to get life.

Jesus could have said: I will give life to you.

Rather, Jesus said: 

I am the resurrection and the life.

Then Jesus setup a challenge, by saying:

“No one comes to the Father but through me.”

What?

Yes - from that day till this day, no other God, no other prophet, no other religion or world system has been able to send a person to the afterlife and back.

What a challenge.

Here’s the twist.

The bible suggests that in the last days, the Anti-Christ will deceive people to believe that he was raised from death;

And boy, the earth will really be excited.

I am telling you, ahead of time - don’t be deceived.
