I prophesy to you today.

That your revelation is greater than that of Elijah the prophet.

For the revelation of Elijah was indeed great.

In that, he, seeing only a small cloud formed, knew there was an abundance of rain.

Even though rain had not fallen for years.

I declare.

You don’t need to see strong wind.

You don’t need to see thunder and lightning or dark clouds.

All you need to know that Yahweh has moved,

Is the entrance of His Word.

In the name of Jesus – amen.

BIBLE VERSE

Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. – James 5:17
