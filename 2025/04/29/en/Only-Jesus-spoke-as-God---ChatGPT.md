QUESTION TO ChatGPT

Is there anywhere in the bible where a person spoke as God? This is apart from Jesus Christ. To clarify, a person speaking for God, would say something like: “Thus says the Lord, I have given you victory”. On the other hand, a person speaking as God would say: “I have given you victory”. It is also important to distinguish between writing what God revealed and speaking as God. When writing what God revealed, there would be no need to say: “Thus says the Lord”. We therefore exclude such from our request. We are interested in places in the bible where a human speaking directly to others spoke as God, except for Jesus. If there are such places where a human spoke as God, please list 3 such instances with the appropriate bible verses for reference. If there is no such place, it is important to say there is no such place in the bible, as that would then be the right answer.

What you're excluding:

* Jesus Christ – You're not asking about Him.

* Writing as God in Scripture – Like when Moses writes God's words in first person (e.g., Deuteronomy), but it's part of written revelation, not speech.

* Prophets saying "Thus says the Lord" – You're looking for speech without this introduction.

What you're looking for:

* A human speaking aloud to others

* Speaking in the first person as if they are God

* No introductory phrase like “Thus says the Lord”

Final Answer

There are no places in the Bible where a human being speaks to others as God (in the first person), without identifying that the words are a message from God. All true prophets distinguish themselves as messengers, not God Himself.

Additional Notes:

* Prophets like Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc., often spoke for God, but they would always make it clear they were speaking on God’s behalf, not as God Himself.

* In Deuteronomy 5:24-27, the people actually ask Moses not to have God speak directly to them, but to be a mediator. Still, Moses relays what God says, never speaking as God.

* False prophets in the Bible sometimes pretend to speak for God, but that's condemned and never endorsed (see Jeremiah 23:16, Ezekiel 13:6).
