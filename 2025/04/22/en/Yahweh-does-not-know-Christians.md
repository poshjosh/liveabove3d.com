It is meaningless to ask: “do you believe in God?”.

Yahweh does not recognize Christians.

Yahweh recognizes believers.

Yahweh also tells us how to identify believers.

Yahweh says: “This is how you know those who believe in me – they will cast our devils, not be hurt by deadly things, and they will heal the sick”.

The question “do you believe in God?” is meaningless to a person who casts our devils and heals the sick.

It is like asking, if I believe the existence of my husband (who I work with and meet every day).

If there is debate about Yahweh existing, it is because there is no true believer at hand.

Stop.

If you are an atheist, focus all your effort on meeting true believers.

If you are a Christian, focus all your effort on knowing Yahweh better, so you can witness Him better.

The single most important decision of your life.

BIBLE VERSE
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. - Mark 16 – 17 -18
