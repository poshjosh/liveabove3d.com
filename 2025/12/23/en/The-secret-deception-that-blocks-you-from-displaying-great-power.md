Humans have become so deceptive,
that we don’t even know when we are deceiving ourselves.
This is a problem because according to James 5 verse 16, earnest words release power. 
Now stick with us till the end, and I guarantee,
that you will earn wisdom which will baffle others.
Hmmm.
Some Christians speak and not much happens.
The bible says that God hears us if we pray according to His will – 1 John 5:14.
God’s will is His word, and His word is the Truth – John 17:17.
Jesus made it clear that God wants us to approach Him,
in Spirit and in Truth – John 4:23.
So, for Christians to get answers to prayers,
They ought to speak in truth.
What does it even mean to speak in truth?
Well, your most trustworthy words,
are those which come from a place rarely visited by you.
For example, when a loved one dies and you wail, then mumble from the weight of sorrow;
Hell dares not challenge the sincerity or earnestness of your words.
Words from the depths of your heart, are often charged with emotion.
Such words are trustworthy, they are spoken – in truth.
Such words release power.
Here is the catch;
When a loved one dies or some other emotionally deep event happens,
people are at their most vulnerable, 
and often end up saying the wrong things.
Imagine you discover that your spouse, in whom you have vested so much, is cheating on you.
You keep thinking, “that ungrateful bastard”.
Then you realize that those thoughts might lead to depression.
So, you ask the Spirit of Truth for help.
When you eventually speak, these words come out of your mouth:
“Devil I know you have struck one blow – but know this”;
“my God, who disgraced you in your own domain – Hades.”
“Will surely confirm His victory by giving me seven blows, which I now ask,”
“And I will enjoy every one of those blows, to the glory of God the Father.”
If you said those words at any other time, they may not amount to much.
However, saying them when you are deeply emotional, 
when you are most vulnerable, takes it to a whole new level.
There’s more.
Think of the most emotional you have been.
Train yourself to have that kind of emotion when you pray.
The best way to achieve this is to let the Holy Spirit drive your passions.
So, you could be wailing for God’s love to prevail in a country you know little about.
Or you could be praying for someone who despitefully used you;
You could be praying for them because the Holy Spirit made it clear that they need help,
because they are at the verge of being lost forever.
Finally,
Strong emotions make you tarry, make you prevail.
When you are deeply hurt, your mind keeps replaying the moment of hurt.
In the same way, when you are deeply moved to pray,
Your mind will keep you praying as it replays what moved you in the first place.
That is how you release tremendous power;
And this is how the bible puts it:
The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man,
makes tremendous power available.
James 5:16.
Has it begun to make sense?

BIBLE VERSES

Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]. - James 5:16 (AMPC)

And this is the confidence which we have before (or toward) Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. – 1 John 5:14 (LSB)

Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth. – John 17:17 (LSB).

But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. – John 4:23 (LSB)
