There is proof of God on earth.
This is a very serious claim that needs tangible and clear evidence.
We will show you the evidence, 
but first lets help you understand the nature of the evidence,
with this thought experiment.

If a man stands before the grave of a girl, who died 5 days ago,
and calls the girl back to life, and the girl comes back to life. 
Then the man says he did it in the name of God.
Will that be enough to prove the existence and love of God?

Remember, we are not talking about Christianity.
Rather we are asking hypothetically, if that single act happens as we describe, 
Will that be enough to prove the existence and love of God?

What is your answer?
Hold that thought.
What if the dead has been raised back to life, like I described, 
only once in the past 70 years?
Does this lack of consistency (or reproducibility) mean that there is no God?
Hmmm.

I ask because in science, if an outcome can only be reproduced 2 percent of the time,
then it is not a miracle and there must be some other explanation.

Let’s look more closely.
If only one in one hundred Christians heals the sick, casts out devils and much more like Jesus said believers would do,
does this imply a success rate of one percent,
or does it imply a success rate of one hundred percent?

The one who designed the process,
told us that the process will succeed every time it is done with one simple ingredient - faith.
Sadly Christians often attempt the process without the required ingredient, 
then others, seeing that the life of Christians does not show any god-like powers,
conclude that there is no God.

Here is wisdom.
If one person can consistently show the power of God in the earth,
then it does not matter what every other person says or does - God exists.


On earth today, there are believers out there who heal the sick, raise the dead and much more, just like Jesus said.
Yes, there are fakes. However, I have already made the point that all it takes is one true believer.
Hmmm.

Here's what to do.
While you are still an atheist, or unbeliever, or even a Christian, decide to search for this truth.
This is very important because our creator recorded this promise to us:
"You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart." - Jeremiah 29:13.
The single most important decision of your life.


BIBLE VERSES

You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. (Jeremiah 29:13).

but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to THE END OF THE EARTH. (Acts 1:8)
