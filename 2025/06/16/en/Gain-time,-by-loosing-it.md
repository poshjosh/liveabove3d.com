You believe in Yahweh Adonai, and you know that prayer is important.

Yet you don’t pray enough.

If that’s you - we have something for you.

The Holy Spirit recently started drawing my attention to the fact that I have enough time.

It then occurred to me that I did not pray at night (for example at 2am) because I thought that it could mess up the next day.

I needed to convince myself that “I have enough time”, to pray at night.

I started “casting down the thought of insufficient time which was trying to exalt itself above the knowledge of God."

And here is the knowledge of God:

If you lose sleep today for Christ's sake, you will gain rest and peace tomorrow.

The “you” who prays at night, has a great advantage over the “you” who does not pray at night, all other things being equal.

If you pursue sleep today, you will lose it tomorrow.

Run with this and be blessed.

BIBLE VERSES

For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. – Matthew 16:21

And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name’s sake, will receive one hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life. - Matthew 9:29

For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the tearing down of strongholds, as we tear down imaginations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled. – 2 Corinthians 10:3-6
