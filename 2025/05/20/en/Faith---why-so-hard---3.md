Faith! Why so hard?

Let’s find out.

There’s a crazy twist at the end; you don’t want to miss.
 
One - Faith is a lifestyle.

If you don’t believe that Yahweh will protect you from danger, how will you believe that He will make you wealthy? 

If you must trust Yahweh, trust Him in all.

Two – The faith of another can help you.

Don’t walk alone, look for someone with stronger faith, to help you. 

Three – Faith works by love.

Even better than asking for help, is when you use your little faith, to help someone with less faith.

Bonus – Without faith it is impossible to please God.

Is God pleased with your life? 

Here’s the twist.

Faith is spiritual, so focus on building your spirit and you will have faith.

Do spiritual things like: forgiving when it is impossible, speaking in a tongue that seems like nonsense or giving money when it would bankrupt you.

Shalom.


BIBLE VERSES

For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “BUT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL LIVE BY FAITH.” – Romans 1:17

Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident, for “THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.” – Galatians 3:11

BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH, AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM. – Hebrews 10:38
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love. – Galatians 5:6
