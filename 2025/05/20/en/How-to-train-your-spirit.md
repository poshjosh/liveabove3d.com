Train your spirit
by doing things 
which only makes sense
if what YHWH says is true.

Now YHWH is saying:
"I have commanded My angels,
To guard you in all your ways."
Psalm 91:11

Take a deep breadth.
Look behind you
and say well done,
to your guardian angel.


BIBLE VERSE

For He will command His angels concerning you,
To guard you in all your ways.
On their hands they will bear you up,
Lest you strike your foot against a stone.
- Psalm 91:11-12
