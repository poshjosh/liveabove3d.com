Faith! Why so hard?

Let’s find out.

There’s a secret at the end; you don’t want to miss.
 
Let’s say you pray to Yahweh for a new job.

One - Faith is spoken.

So, you have to say that God, “has given”, you a new job. 

Two - Faith comes by hearing the word of God.

So, have faith; by listening to Jesus, who is saying:

“If P. Diddy being evil gave his son a 360 thousand dollars Mercedes, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him”

Matthew 7 verse 11.

Three - Faith is a journey, in which the end is declared from the beginning.

So, no matter what happens, continue saying that God, “has given”, you a new job.

To understand this better, you need to watch our video on Beyonce’s missing ring.

Part 2 of this revelation comes out tomorrow, so follow us to receive.

BIBLE VERSE

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him! – Matthew 7:11
