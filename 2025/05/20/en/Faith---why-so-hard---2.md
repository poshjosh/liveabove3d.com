Faith! Why so hard?

Let’s find out.

At the end, there’s something special to encourage you; don’t miss it.
 
Let’s say you pray to Yahweh for a new job.

One - Faith will be tested.

It is January and your friend asks, if you plan to travel in the summer. 

You say no, because with your current job, you can’t afford the holiday. 

Just like that, you failed the test, because you did not believe you will have a new job by summer.

Two – You already have faith

So, know that even if you fail a test, you have enough faith, to grow your faith, till you pass the test, the next time.

Three – You will be tested as many times as you use your faith.

So, cheer up, say something and stand by it, then you will be tested.

Part 3 of this revelation comes out on Friday, so follow us to receive.

BIBLE VERSE

That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: - 1 Peter 1:7

For through the grace given to me I say to each one among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound thinking, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. – Romans 12:3
