Here are 3 things Jesus will never say.

Three ways we should never speak.

One – Fear.

Jesus will never say “be careful”; or “I am afraid they will not listen”.

Two – Uncertainty.

Jesus will never say “I don’t know”. For example, “I don’t know why you struggle to trust me”. 

Three – Apology.

Jesus will never apologize. For example, “I am sorry for arriving late”.

Of these three (fear, uncertainty and apology) only one is “not” a sin.

Guess which?

Let us know in the comments section.

BIBLE VERSES

For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the entire body as well. – James 3:2

But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment. – Matthew 12;36
