Even if God does not love me the way He has shown (and is showing), I would still be a Christian.

I believe that we know too little to judge the mind of one who knows everything.

I also believe that anyone who creates you has a right over you.

If you say no, then I ask you this:

Imagine that you create a house. 

The house is the glory of your effort after working at a company for 35 years.

Just when you are about to move into your house, your house comes alive and says:

“You know what, I’d rather be a refuse dump”

How could we turn our breathe-taking Louvre Museum, located at the center of our city, into a refuse dump?

What would you do?

I guarantee, that you will lovingly discipline that house.

That is, unless you are willing to let your child do anything and have anything like Will and Jada Pinkett Smith.

What do you think?

BIBLE VERSE

If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and out of your hand, O king, let him deliver us. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up. – Daniel 3:17-18
