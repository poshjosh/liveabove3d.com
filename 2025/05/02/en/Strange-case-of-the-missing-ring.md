Imagine that you are in your bedroom.

You try to put a priceless gold ring back into its case.

The ring falls and rolls away.

You walk to where the ring rolled to, but you do not find it there.

You are confused.

At that point, your true belief shines through.

You will not say that the ring disappeared, because rings don’t disappear.

Neither will you say that you never held the ring in your hand.

Rather, you insist that the ring is somewhere in the room.

Let’s switch things.

You pray and believe, then nothing changes.

You are confused.

Rather than insisting that the change you need is close,

Or that you need to increase your faith, 

You go around telling people: “I prayed and believed but nothing changed”.

Do you see the problem?

The case of the missing ring is still open, but the case of what you prayed for - is closed, by the words of your mouth.

This needs to be explained to a lot of Christians.

Do the right thing and share this with someone who needs to know.
