Here are 4 things Jesus will never say.

Four ways we should never speak.

The fourth one will surprise you. 

There is also a question at the end, very few will get right.

One – Fear.

Jesus will never show fear. For example, “I am afraid they will not listen”.

Two – Ignorance.

Jesus will never speak ignorantly. For example, “I don’t know why you struggle to trust me”. 

Three – Apology.

Jesus will never apologize. For example, “I am sorry for arriving late”.

Four – Uncertainty.

Jesus will never be unsure. For example, “I believe we will win the court case”.

You see, saying “I believe” is often a good sign that you do not.

To better understand faith, watch our series on faith, linked in the description below.

Now you know 4 ways Jesus will never speak.

Of these four (fear, ignorance, apology and uncertainty) only one is “not” a sin.

Guess which.

Let us know in the comments section.

But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment. – Matthew 12;36
