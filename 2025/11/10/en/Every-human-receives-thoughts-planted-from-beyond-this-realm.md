How do you know; what you know?
Science and reason rely on measurement and data.
For Christians, God tells us, often through an inner voice.
The Holy Spirit often speaks through our heart or mind.

For it is written: 
“But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes,” 
“He will guide you into all the truth;” 
“for He will not speak from Himself,” 
“but whatever He hears, He will speak;” 
“and He will disclose to you what is to come.”
John 16 verse 13.

The thing is, I also speak through my mind.
Even worse, evil ones (beyond this realm) also speak through my mind.
For it is written:
Minds can be corrupted from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ,
out of such minds come evil thoughts, 
so guard your heart with all diligence,
for from it flow the springs of life.
2 Corinthians 11:3, Matthew 15:19 and Proverbs 4:23.

Hmmm.
Every human on earth receives thoughts, planted from beyond this realm.
So, we need to differentiate between God’s voice and our voice.
For this we need to rely on what we truly believe.
We need to rely on what is moving us to act - Love or self.
If I am drawn by the grace and beauty of a girl,
and my heart tells me she is my wife;
then I can safely say that it is my “self” speaking.
If am worried about going broke,
but my heart tells me to give to the poor,
then I can safely say that it is Love speaking.
Remember – God is love.

Hmmm.
Now here is a curious example:
Is the rapture pre, mid or post tribulation?
The bible is deliberately not clear enough about this, for good reason.
If my heart tells me that the rapture is pre, mid or post tribulation,
how can I say that it is God speaking?
This is usually where I say some nail-in-the-head hitting phrase, 
but I have none, for good reason.
Let the Holy Spirit guide you!
