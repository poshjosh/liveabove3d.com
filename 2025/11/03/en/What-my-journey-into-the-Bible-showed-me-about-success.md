Do you know that the more you are successful in your abilities,
the less you will be successful in Gods?
So, the adversary gives us little problems to solve.
By solving them, we build confidence in ourselves.
When we are very confident, the adversary sends the big problem which only God can solve.
Being good Christians, we pray to God,
Then we do what we know how to do best.
We work our own way to solve the problem.
Praying to God and doing your thing, is not acceptable.
Hmmm.
Make it a habit to honour the Holy Spirit.
Involve Him fully in your life.
Always ask His advice.
Involve Him in your little problems.
Even when you know how to solve them.
This way, when you need help for the great battles.
His Help will be natural.
The supernatural will be natural.
Remember -
At the point of trouble,
You are meant to use the faith you have already built.
Also, anyone who trusts the Holy Spirit,
in little things,
will easily trust the Holy Spirit,
in big things.
Has it begun to make sense?

BIBLE VERSE

Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,
And do not lean on your own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge Him,
And He will make your paths straight.
Proverbs 3:5-6 (LSB)
