In a time of violence, manipulation, wickedness all over the world.
This is God’s record:
“The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of God, 
as the waters cover the sea.”
Habakkuk 2 verse 14.
I declare today that you are part of the fulfilment of God’s word.
Whatever you are facing,
a change that will glorify God - is at hand.
In Jesus Name – amen.
Hmmm.
What is this glory?
Hebrews 1 verse 3 says that Jesus is the brightness of God’s glory.
No wonder that we are asked to keep our eyes on Jesus – Hebrews 12 verse 2.
Because as we keep our eyes on the glory of God – that is Jesus,
we are transformed into the same image from one level of glory to higher levels. – 2 Corinthians 3 verse 18.
How? How?
Think of how Jesus would behave if He faced your situation.
Remember, Jesus had 5 loaves and 2 fish to feed 5 thousand men.
He did not hesitate, or calculate,
rather He blessed what He had, thanked God for it, 
and immediately used it to feed the 5 thousand.
That is the glory of God.
God is saying that as you keep your eyes on this behaviour, 
you will be transformed into the person who behaves that way.
WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW! 
Isn’t He awesome, isn’t He awesome?
Christ is awesome.    
Hallelujah!

Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. - Luke 9:13-17
