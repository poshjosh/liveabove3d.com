1. Lucifer saw God, but rebelled.

2. Adam saw God, but rebelled.

3. The Israelites saw God, were terrified and 
asked that Moses stand between them and God, 
yet they rebelled.

So, God Himself, came in human form to relate with humans.

4. The pharisees saw this God in human form and killed Him.

5. Peter the disciple, who had seen God in human form - denied Him.

Guess what?

6. Atheists are asking to see God before they believe.

Hmmm.

No one is falling for that.

BIBLE VERSES

And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. - Revelation 12:7-10 (LSB)

How you have fallen from heaven, O star (shining one) of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the nations! But you said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly; In the recesses of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High." - Isaiah 14:12-14 (LSB)

Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool (breeze) of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God in the midst of the trees of the garden. Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" And he said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid." And He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?" - Genesis 3:8-12 (LSB)

And all the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and the people perceived it, and they shook and stood at a distance. Then they said to Moses, "Speak to (with) us yourself, and we will listen; but let not God speak to (with) us, lest we die." - Exodus 20:18-19 (LSB)

And behold, a man was there whose hand was withered. And they questioned Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" — so that they might accuse Him. And He said to them, "What man is there among you who has a sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable then is a man than a sheep! So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath." Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal (health), like the other. But going out, the Pharisees took counsel together against Him, as to how they might destroy Him. - Matthew 12:10-14 (LSB)

And six days later Jesus brought with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." - Matthew 17:1-4 (LSB)

Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean." But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about." And when he had gone out to the gateway, another servant-girl saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth." And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man." A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of them; for even the way you talk gives you away." Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and cried bitterly. - Matthew 26:69–75 (LSB)
