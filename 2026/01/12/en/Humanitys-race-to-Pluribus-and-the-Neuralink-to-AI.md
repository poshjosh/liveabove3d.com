The race to control humanity is heating up, and it all has to do with the mind.

To understand what is going on, we ask some questions.

What is the best form of communication?

What has it got to do with "Pluribus" the TV show, Christianity or Neuralink?

COMMUNICATION

Communication is a trillion-dollar problem - and solution.

In communication, space-time can distort the message,

enemies can intercept the message,

or the recipient can mis-read the message.

Differences in thinking is the cause of most conflict.

In theory, all these problems are solved when both the sender and recipient are part of a hive mind.

Despite its appeal, there are implicit problems with a hive mind.

PLURIBUS

The problems with a hive mind are exposed by the Apple TV series: "Pluribus".

In "Pluribus", the aliens transmit a signal that causes a "Joining" event.

The joining transforms most of humanity into a shared hive mind.

The hive mind leads to zero crime and the end of all conflict amongst other benefits.

However, watching the show, questions begin to arise.

Why is joining the hive not optional?

Why is no one trying to leave the hive?

Do you lose your freewill when you join the hive?

Or is the hive mind so alluring that no one ever wants to leave.

Do you still have free will if something is so enticing that you never want to leave it?

The show “Pluribus” does a good job weighing free will against a problem-free world.

Would you join a hive mind?

What if the hive mind is based on love and is offered by your creator who is all-powerful?

Don’t you think your creator deserves some submission and loyalty from you?

If you reject love, what have you accepted in its place?

Before we answer that, lets show you Christianity.

CHRISTIANITY

Consider the following quotes from the bible: 

Jesus is the head, and all His believers are the body of one – Christ. 

Ephesians 1 verses 22 and 23 as well as Colossians 1verse 18.

Jesus is the tree and all His believers are the branches. (John 15:5)

Anyone joined to Jesus is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17).

Christ is the wisdom of believers. (1 Corinthians 1:30)

Believers have the mind of Christ. (1 Corinthians 2:16)

Hmmm.

In simple terms every believer in Jesus has one mind and one spirit, 

with Jesus being the head and Wisdom of the whole.

Does this mean that we will lose free will when the plan of God matures?

The consensus among Christians is that we will not lose our free will.

In God’s kingdom, we will have the knowledge to see sin for the “filth” it truly is and will naturally reject it,

the same way an adult has the free will to eat poison but chooses not to.

Now the big question.

If something is so good that those who enter refuse to exit,

why would you refuse to enter?

One good reason may be fear of the unknown.

However, your answer is irrelevant until you consider the future of mankind.

Many science enthusiasts agree that the most efficient form of co-existing is in a kind of hive mind.

These enthusiasts also see a future where human minds are connected.

This will probably be achieved by a future version of Neuralink, aided by artificial intelligence.

NEURALINK

Neuralink is a neurotechnology company by Elon Musk. 

The company develops technology to connect brains to computers.

Its core device, "the Link," is a coin-sized implant which is surgically placed in the skull, 

to record neural activity and transmit it wirelessly to digital devices like phones or computers. 

So, we can read brain signals. 

We are also learning to write brain signals.

Soon we will be able to improve our minds.

One day, everyone with Neuralink will be so smart as to make everyone without Neuralink obsolete.

Here’s the thing.

Can you resist a world where 95 percent of people are part of a superior mind?

A world where the remaining 5 percent will have no job, no appeal and no future.

FINALLY

Why would anyone resist Christianity (which balances freewill and union with a loving creator), 

only to accept a human controlled mind upgrade in the future?
Hmmm.

You will be part of a hive mind – you just need to decide which one.

Here’s what you should do.

Accept Christ today.

Also, don’t accept any solution (digital or otherwise) that could affect your mind or DNA.

If you are not sure, just say no.

To be fore-warned is to be fore-armed.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSES

And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. (Ephesians 1:22-23)

And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. (Colossians 1:18)
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. (Ephesisans 5:23)

I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. (John 15:5)

But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. (1 Corinthians 6:17)

But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: (1 Corinthians 1:30)

For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ. (1 Corinthians 2:16)
