“Why does God not just show Himself?”

Here's one thought experiment to answer that.

There was once a region which was known for the lies of its inhabitants.
How that region became full of liars is a tale for another day.
One year, a dangerous disease broke out in the “region of lies”.
Shortly after, many cures were being marketed by various residents of the “region of lies”.
Unfortunately, none of the cures were true and people started doubting anyone who brought a cure.
The king of all regions now has the cure and is sending you to bring the cure to the “region of lies”.
How would you do it?
Bear in mind that many before you claimed to have brought a cure from the king, 
only to fleece the unsuspecting and run away with their money.
How would you bring the cure to those who need it?
Think about this for a minute.

If you stand in the town square and inject yourself with the disease and thereafter administer the cure, 
someone will accuse you of deception. 
Someone else will say that the stuff you injected yourself with, was not really the disease.
Things can get quite tricky.
Here’s what you should do.

Insert yourself in a circle of people, 
Establish yourself as truthful, dependable and consistent.
Teach your circle of friends the importance of truth, and the need to spread truthfulness.
Begin to do things only someone sent by the king can do,
but don’t tell them you are sent by the king yet.
One day your closest friends will realize that you are probably sent by the king.
Let them come and ask you, if you were sent by the king.
Then ask them to bring a vial of the disease.
Inject yourself and thereafter cure yourself.
Show them the cures you have brought from the king, 
then ask them to spread the truth about the cure.
If your friends have been truthful and consistent, 
it should not be too difficult for each of them to follow in your footstep.
Eventually the truth and the cure will prevail.

This is akin to letting the truth show itself, 
so that those who are drawn to that kind - will come to it.
This is how Jesus spread the truth about Himself.
This is also how Christians are to prove the existence of God.
Show the world love, care for them by using God’s power, 
to heal the sick, raise the dead and more.
Put simply.
If you directly expose the truth to people who have grown accustomed to a lie,
conflict may break out, especially if the author and benefactors of those lies are unwilling to change.

Christianity is this way because Lucifer challenged God’s dominion.
God did not end Lucifer instantly, 
because that would leave Lucifer’s challenge, accusations and lies unanswered.
Rather, God let the truth show itself,
to the extent that God himself came as the human messenger of the cure,
injected himself with the problem (which was sin and death) then cured himself.
So that we may know that he has the solution, without Him shoving it down our throats.
So that those who are drawn to that kind, will freely come to Him.
If you are drawn to that kind,
you will seek God, find God, then receive power to become proof of God to others.

Decide now, to search for the truth.
The single most important decision of your life.


BIBLE VERSES

You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. (Jeremiah 29:13).

but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to THE END OF THE EARTH. (Acts 1:8)
