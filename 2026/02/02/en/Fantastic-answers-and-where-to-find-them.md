What we reveal today, will make you receive the answer to whatever you asked God.
It will surprise you.
Hmmm.
Peter asked Jesus, “if it is you, tell me to come”.
Jesus could have said, “why do you doubt” or “don’t test the Lord your God”.
Rather, Jesus said - “come”.
Demons asked Jesus, “let us go into those pigs”.
Jesus could have said, “return to everlasting fire”.
Rather, Jesus said – “go”.
I am here to remind you that Jesus answers prayers, even those of demons.
Let - that - sink - in.
The religious leaders of the day asked Jesus for a miracle from heaven.
Jesus refused.
What is the difference between peter and the religious leaders?
The religious leaders asked for a sign.
Peter asked for a word.
Peter could have asked Jesus, “please lift me over the water”.
Rather he asked Jesus, “tell me to come”.
Let - that - sink - in.
If you believe God has answered, but don’t know how to receive.
Act on the word, just as Peter did when he stepped on water.
If you can’t act on the word, or hesitate before acting,
Then you need to feed on this next word, till it takes over your heart.
“If you believe that whatever you say is going to happen, you will have whatever you say.” - Mark 11:23B
Let - that - sink - in.

BIBLE VERSES

And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. - Matthew 14:22-29 (KJV)
 
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. - Matthew 8:28-32 (KJV)

If you remain in Me and My words remain in you [that is, if we are vitally united and My message lives in your heart], ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. - John 15:7 (AMP)

And the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign (or attesting miracle) from heaven, testing Him. And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation." - Mark 8:11-12 (LSB)

but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith - Mark 11:23 (KJV)
