Trump has a special role, and it is not what you think.

Hmmm.

Nine countries have nuclear weapons.

These countries are divided into those for and against Israel.

United States, France, United Kingdom and India support Israel.

Russia, China, Pakistan, and North Korea oppose Israel.

We believe the Antichrist will emerge through one of these countries.

Only a leader with nuclear weapons can rule the world - as expected of the Antichrist.

Soon, a war will be fought; whose fallout will be so severe that Israel and indeed the world will be forced to the peace table.

The leaders of both the USA and Russia will be major players in this war.

One of those leaders could be the Antichrist. 

Hmmm.

Whoever is the president of the USA, then:

Either - that person is the Anti-Christ.

Or - that person will be defeated by the Antichrist.

I see Trump leading to USA’s defeat, because he believes Putin, more than he believes USA’s security experts.

What do you think?

Let me know in the comments section.
