They keep telling you, that you need to be cured of a deadly illness.

You don’t feel sick, but the cure is free.

Do you take the cure?

Hmmm.

You accept the cure, as there is no downside.

Each of 2 men claim to have the cure.

Tim says he has a cure, and that Tom also has a cure.

Tom says he has a cure, but that Tim’s cure is fake.

Which cure will you choose?

Hmmm.

You choose Tom’s cure, as there is no downside.

Tom has 2 pills, from which you must choose one.

The blue pill needs you to only believe, for it to cure you.

The red pill needs you to do a long list of things (for the rest of your life) for it to cure you.

Which pill will you choose?

Hmmm.

Here is wisdom.

The cure is - belief in God.

Tim refers to religions which say there are many ways, while Tom refers to religions which say there is only one way.

The blue pill is Christianity.

Make the right choice.

The most important decision of your life.
