You create a video game.

You promise to respect the choices of the game characters.

One day, the characters in your video game ask you to keep off.

With time, the game characters lose the ability to hear you and gain the ability to do things themselves.

Not bad. 

However, the characters mess up.

Things are so bad that some characters begin to question whether you exist.

Now, even if you speak to your game characters, they will not hear for they lost that ability.

Also, they asked you to keep off, so you can’t help them directly.

You love your game characters, so you create a new character for yourself.

Characters who are controlled by others are called avatars.

Your avatar goes around your game saying: “Hey, I have the solution to all your problems, however I can only help those who agree for me to”.

Hmmm.

The avatar that came to reveal God is: “Jesus Christ”.

No more games.

What is your response to his offer?

The single most important response of your life.
