Christians say that if you don’t submit to Jesus, you will be punished.

If we are created with free will, why should we be punished for not submitting?

Hmmm.

At a point in the future, either:

One – What God wants will happen, or

Two – What you want will happen.

Option 2 is a life without God.

Without God to set a standard, anyone can do whatever they want.

The thing is:

The stronger beings take advantage of this freedom, to torture the weaker ones.

We call such a place – hell.

Do you want to live under the “wisest government ever”?

Or do you want to live in a free for all, with disobedient beings who are far more powerful than you and have spent thousands of years in bitterness?

Remember, you are created in the image of God, so those disobedient beings will take out their anger on you.

This is why it is very important that you turn to God – now!

Shalom.
