How can a person who owns a car, say that cars do not exist?

You’ll be surprised, so watch till the end.

Hmmm.

Every person on earth can speak without moving their tongue.

Shut your mouth, then use your mind to say: “I am speaking without speaking”.

Try it now.

There’s more.

Every person on earth can see with their eye lids shut.

Imagine a red ball on a white table in a room with one window.

Try it now.

Hmmm.

It seems that there is someone inside of each of us.

So, I ask.

How can a person who has a soul, say that souls do not exist?

Atheists experience what we just did; yet they prefer other explanations.

This is even though several scientists have documented near-death experiences - which point to humans having a soul.

Dear atheists.

You don’t need to believe in God, to know that there is more to reality than the physical.

Shalom.
