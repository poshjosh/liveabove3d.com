This video will challenge your beliefs.

Hmmm.

You arrive at a small Island where years of scientific research indicate there are no wild animals.

As you settle for the night you hear a loud roar and see the bush rustling fast in your direction.

What do you do?

Everyone I know (including the scientists who researched the island) would be startled and begin to protect themselves – just in case.

This behavior is called street smarts.

In theory, we gather info to make the right choice.

However, it is often difficult to gather enough info. 

In such cases we must use street smarts.

Here are 3 such cases:

One - Either God exists or not.

There is no downside, if God does not exist, and we believe in Him.

However, there is an eternal and final downside, if God exists, and we ignore Him.

So, using street smarts, we choose to believe in God.

But which?

Two – Some religions allow you to practice other religions, some religions do not allow this.
Here’s the thing.

In which country would you prefer to break the law? 

One in which anything goes, or one in which the law is highly respected.

If you break the law, in a country where anything goes, you may get away with it.

We can get away with ignoring religions which allow us to practice others, but we can’t get away with ignoring strict religions.

So, we stick to the stricter religions – generally the Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

But which?

Three – In some religions, you earn your place with God; in others God earns a place for you.

Do you want to earn your place; or would you rather have God do it for you?

Let me know what you have chosen, or will choose, in the comments section.

Hmmm.

Before you answer, know that Christianity is the only religion where God earns a place for you.

Sincerely, find out about Christianity.

The single most important decision of your life.

Shalom.


What you didn’t know about Christianity

The greatest love is when one lays their life down for their friends. 

God showed this kind of love by giving his one-of-a-kind Son to die, so that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have the God kind of life. 

The Son of God (Jesus Christ) suffered and died for your sins - the sinless for the sinful - so that He might bring you to God. 

Here is the reason behind that: If the sinless God can suffer the death of humans, then the sinful human can enjoy the life of God.

It was a legal and just victory. All you need to do is accept it by believing in the person who won the victory for us – Jesus the Christ.

BIBLE VERSES

Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.

John 15:13

For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

John 3:16

God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Romans 5:7-8

For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, so that He might bring you to God

1 Peter 3:18

For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were appointed sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be appointed righteous.

Romans 5:19
