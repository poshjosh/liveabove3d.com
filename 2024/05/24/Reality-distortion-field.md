You pray and nothing happens.

Hmm.

Remember Steve Jobs? - the man who co-founded Apple Computer.

He spoke of a “reality distortion field”.

He meant an atmosphere that shapes the reality to birth what you want.

An atmosphere for miracles.

An atmosphere for miracles will play by a different set of rules.

The Pharisees did not like this. 

So, they asked Jesus why his disciples did not live according to the traditions of the elders.

Jesus replied to them: “You have made the word of God of no effect, through your tradition” – Mark 7:23.

Simply put - after praying, what you do, can make the word of God of no effect.

Imagine praying to receive a contract for 10 million dollars.

At some point, you have to start checking your mailbox, say – every hour – till the contract mail arrives.

Doing this, shapes your atmosphere around what is most important – the contract mail.

If you know someone who has prayed for something and is expecting, share this video with them – thank me later.



BIBLE VERSES

Surely there is a future [and a reward],
And your hope and expectation will not be cut off.

Proverbs 23:18 (Amplified Bible)
7 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.
12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
Mark 7:1-13
