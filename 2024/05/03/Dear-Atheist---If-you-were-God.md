Dear Atheist.

How would you prove you exist – If you were God?

Here’s the thing.

Soon, artificial intelligence will think like humans.

Then, video game characters (often called avatars); will also think like humans.

Like humans, those avatars will ask themselves questions like:

Is there an intelligent creator?

Why would our creators not show themselves?

If you were the creator of such a video game; how would you prove you exist?

Hmm.

Well; one human claimed to be the avatar; the icon; the image of our creator.

His believers called him Jesus, the anointed one, the savior.

He said that everyone who believed in him would receive the spirit of our creator.

He also said that the Spirit gives believers power to prove the existence of our creator.

I love the way God chose to prove his existence.

Rather than continuously interfering with humans, God made his power available to us.

What do you think?

Let me know in the comments section.

BIBLE VERSES

8 Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” 9 Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. 11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves.
12 “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. 13 Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If you ask me[e] anything in my name, I will do it.
John 14:8-14

...You shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judaea, in Samaria, and up to the ends of the earth.

Acts 1:8
