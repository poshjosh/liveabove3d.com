Does free will exist?

With a simple thought experiment, we will show that free will exists and - also does not.

Hmm.

Imagine we have 2 individuals for which, each atom in their body has, the exact same properties. 

Also, each atom has experienced, the exact same events.

Is it possible for one of the 2 individuals to act differently, at least once?

What if there are an infinite number of this individual?

Given an infinite amount of time, if one of an infinite number of the same individual, takes a left turn instead of right, then free will exists.

So, yes – free will exists.

However, I believe that the events you experience can increase or decrease your free will.

Not just your free will, but those of your descendants.

Remember, our genes influence our actions – our actions also influence our genes.

One last note.

Humankind has free will, we are free even to limit our free will.
