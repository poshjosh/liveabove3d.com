Oh man; who bewitched you?

You trample on precious gifts.

Do you know that the universe was created by words?

In Genesis 1, God spoke several times to create.

Many miss that the creations at that point, were only in the spirit realm.

In fact, Genesis 2, tells us how the creations manifested.

God caused it to rain, then man softened the ground.

So, words are creative, yet humans misuse them.

Words are a signed contract.

No wonder Jesus said: “Men shall give account of every idle word they speak”.

Do you know that the worlds media bewitches your spirit?

You remain bewitched, as long as you still say, what you don’t mean. 

Here is what you need to do.

First, correct the way you use words, then the Holy Spirit will rain on your words.

Finally, soften the ground, by responding, ahead of manifestation.

Shalom.
