Where am I? 

What is this corner?

Why are the walls closing in?

Oh, I am trapped by my blunder.

The shadows are weighing in.

“How will light come?” – I wonder.

“When the walls are closing in”.

Hmmm.

I remember.

My God calls light out of darkness.

Seated at the right hand of the Power,

Is His grace and his kindness.

I cast myself asunder.

I lean upon his highness.

Then, I look and behold - wonder.

Glory and brightness.

He said.

“I am”
