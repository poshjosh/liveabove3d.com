When last did you cry?

What has this got to do with temptation?

It’ll surprise you.

Hmmm.

Do you keep falling back to the same weakness?

Just when you begin to move on, you find yourself at the same weakness.

I could tell you why this happens – but I’d rather tell you how to overcome.

For that Jesus says

“Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation”

So, watch - follow the lead of God’s spirit, and pray.

Then, when temptation comes, your response will glorify God.

Hmmm.

What if you are not encouraged to pray seriously?

Then you need that light of God which makes us pray.

You heard that right - it is God who makes us pray.

So, cry to God, for the Lord hears and will deliver you from weakness.

Remember, even our Saviour Jesus, in the days of his flesh,  offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, and he was heard because of his reverence.

Shalom.
