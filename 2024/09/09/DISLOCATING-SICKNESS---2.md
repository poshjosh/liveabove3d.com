In Part 1, we used words to dislocate sickness.

Even so, the devil will try to sneak in wrong thoughts.

Dislocate him with these answers.

“It’s just a minor sickness.”

Jesus became sickness and endured, so that I do not have to suffer this.

If I endure this sickness for even the shortest time, then I will be making Jesus’s suffering in vain. 

“You are not right with God, yet you want to be healed.”

If Jesus who knew no sin, became sin on my behalf; then I who know sin, have become the righteousness of God.

“This sickness is a test.” 

It is ok for you, oh sickness, to ask God’s permission to test me.

It is also ok for me, to cast you out - as God has authorized me.

I pass the test; I cast you out now – In Jesus name.

Bless others by sharing this with them.

Shalom.
