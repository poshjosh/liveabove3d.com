Never tolerate sickness.

Here are powerful words to dislocate sickness.

Hmmm.

Oh sickness, I know the truth.

It is written and now I say: “By his wounds I was healed”

Jesus became sickness and endured, so that I do not have to suffer this.

If I endure you for even the shortest time, then I will be making Jesus’s suffering in vain.

No! Not me. 

Not my Father in heaven – who will not allow any injustice.

Since Jesus suffered, then I enjoy, in his name.

Oh sickness, hear the unfailing word of God.

Since Jesus did not suffer in vain, I yank you from my body, in Jesus’ name.

Die sickness, and be no more, for by the wounds of Jesus, I was healed.

Hallelujah! 

The second part of this video is coming out tomorrow.

I believe that God wants you to watch it.

Subscribe, and you will be notified.

Shalom.
