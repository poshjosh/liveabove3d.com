See if you can solve this riddle.

Two persons enter a room, then exit it and tell us what they see.

The first person says that he saw a man in the room.

The second person says that he did not see any man in the room.

What would you do, if you want to find out if there is a man in the room. 

Hmmm.

In theory, you should talk to both persons who entered the room.

However, in practice, the person who did not see any man in the room is of no use to you.

He may be partially blind, he may have been distracted – whatever the case, he is of no use.

You need to focus on the person who saw a man in the room, to find out if that person is lying.

For example, you need to ask yourself: “what would they gain by lying?”

Hmmm.

Here’s the thing.

Never listen to an atheist when it comes to the existence of God.

Shalom
