Dear Christian,

Jesus has paid the cost of all our sins, even our future sins.

Does this mean that we should sin?

Hmmm.

If the president promises to pardon all your offences no matter what or when – should you commit offences?

I think not.

You see, God paid the cost of all our sins, so that we can freely choose to live right.

We should choose to live right,

Not because of the fear of paying the cost of sin,

But because we know that sin makes the world a worse place.

There’s more.

You see, humans cannot live without sinning, so God gave us His spirit to help us.

Anyone who allows themselves to be guided by the Spirit of God, can live forever without sin.

God is gathering everyone that meets this requirement.

The requirement for an everlasting kingdom of righteousness, peace and joy.

Shalom.
