Crying and begging doesn’t work well with God.

Here we go.

She cried out to Jesus for help.

Jesus did not answer.

She then gathered prayers from powerful believers to Jesus.

Jesus answered: “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel”.

She then worshiped and begged Jesus for help.

Jesus replied: “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs”.

For the first time, she heard what Jesus had been saying.

Light had come and she knew what was blocking her answers.

She then gave a wise response:

“Yes Lord, but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their master’s table”.

Jesus then replied: “Your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish.”

At those words, she received her answer.

So, don’t just pray repeatedly.

Stop - find out what God is saying – then respond wisely.

Share with someone who needs to know – do it now.
