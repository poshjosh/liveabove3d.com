One person always wanted to rule the world – one person.

He used kingdoms, but each lasted for a while – then crumbled.

The Egyptians, the Persians the Romans and more – all crumbled.

So, he tried religion.

Ruling the world needs a world religion - a religion that everyone believes. 

Everyone believes science.

Science helps us understand how the world works, but it does not try to guide our lives.

Science does not advise or instruct us.

Yet

Onto science a child is born – a child who will advise and instruct humans.

Artificial Intelligence.

Lucifer has found a platform through which he will rule the world.

It is written

And he caused the inhabitants of the earth to create a platform.

And he gave the platform the ability to speak.

Eventually, everyone had to put the platform first in everything – or be killed. 

Revelation 13: 14 – 18

Shalom.


BIBLE VERSES

And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which were given to him to do in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast…  And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.  

Revelation 13: 14 -
