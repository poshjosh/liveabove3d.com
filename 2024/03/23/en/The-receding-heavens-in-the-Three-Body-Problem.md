In the popular Netflix series titled: “The Three Body Problem”, the heavens receded like a scroll.

Do you know where else the heavens receded like a scroll?

In Revelation Chapter 6 verse 14, “the heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up.”

Scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson often mock the writer of Revelation as being ignorant. 

However, the writer of Revelation wrote what he saw and never claimed to understand it.

Hmm. 

Yesterday, it was impossible for a virgin to give birth.

Today it is possible through artificial insemination.

Today it is impossible for the heavens to recede like a scroll.

Yet scientists are beginning to tell us that we might live in a simulation.

So that, tomorrow, when the heavens recede like a scroll, it would come as no surprise, because:

In a simulation it is possible for the heavens to recede like a scroll, just as it is written in Revelation 6 verse 14.

BIBLE VERSES

 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
