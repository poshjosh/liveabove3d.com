In Part 1, we showed that words can create matter.

However, there is a particular quality of words required to create anything.

In Mark 11:23 God tells us that: 

“whoever says to this mountain, be removed, and be cast into the sea; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes; he shall have whatever he says”.

The absence of doubt - or what christians call faith - is what gives words creative abivlity.

So; what is faith?

Hmm.

A clay vessel placed before a light bulb will cast a shadow.

God is the light bulb and his word is the light.

This physical world is the shadow. 

The clay vessel is spirit substance - in the fourth dimension.

The fourth dimension is more real than our physical world, just as the clay vessel is more real than its shadow.

You – a shadow – will have faith, when you become aware, of the spirit substance – that is the real substance – of what you desire.

Next; we show how to have faith.

BIBLE VERSES

For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

Mark 11:23
