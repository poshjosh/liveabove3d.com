Previously we showed that faith comes when we are aware of the reality in the fourth dimension.

How can we be aware of the fourth dimension; or the spirit realm.

Hmm.

It is written and now I say:

“Faith comes by hearing the word of God” – Romans 10:17a

So, how can you hear the word of God?

It is written and now I say:

“Hearing the word of God, comes by the word of God” – Romans 10:17b.

Now you have it.

You get faith by hearing the word of God. 

You hear the word of God - by the word of God.

Its all about the word of God.

Once upon a time, wisdom was the principal thing – Proverbs 4:7a.

Then came the word of God saying:

“A greater than solomon is here” – Matthew 12:42b.

While the world marvels at the wisdom of men like Elon Musk, you should live by what God’s word reveals.

In our final part, we give practical tips to hear God and live by faith.

BIBLE VERSES

So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

Romans 10:17

Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.

The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
