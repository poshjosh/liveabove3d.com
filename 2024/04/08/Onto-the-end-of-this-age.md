Who shall enter heaven? 

What about rapture?

Concerning this, Jesus, in John 15:6, said that unfruitful Christians would be cast into the fire.

What many do not know is that our fruits are rotten if they are not inspired by God.

In fact, 1 Corinthians 3:13 reveals that fire shall try every person’s work.

Jesus also reveals, in Mathew 7, that he will reject some “fruit producing” Christians.

So; it is important to know if your fruit is good.

To that, Jesus said, that fruit bearing christians will be purged to bear more fruit.

So, good fruit produces increase in the life of a Christian.

Not an increase in material things, but an increase in the same ability which produced good fruit.

No wonder Proverbs 4:18 says that the righteous shines brighter with time.

You see, it is not the level at which you are that matters, but whether you are increasing.

Hmm.

You should be increasing; when the trumpet sounds.

BIBLE VERSES

5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

Mathew 7:22-23
