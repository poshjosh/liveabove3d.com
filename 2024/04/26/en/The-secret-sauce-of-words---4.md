We have shown that having faith is all about the word of God.

The word of God brings a revelation of the reality in the fourth dimension or spirit realm.

So how do we get this revelation.

Hmm.

Jesus says that the sheep hear the voice of the shepherd – John 10:27.

Why would one not hear their shepherd’s voice?

Another voice – that’s why.

Imagine your shepherd and 99 other voices calling out to you.

With some training, your ear can drown out every other voice in favour of your shepherds.

Here are three voices on healing:

God heals when he wants.

God heals if we believe.

God heals if we are right with him.

Is none right? Is one right? Or is it more than one?

Whatever the case, the Holy spirit is the spirit of truth – John 16:13a.

So, here is a tip.

Live your life asking the Holy Spirit.

Even when you know the answer.

Live your life asking the Holy Spirit.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSES

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

John 10:27

Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

John 16:13
