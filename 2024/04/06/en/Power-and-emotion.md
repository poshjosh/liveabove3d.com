Have you ever seen a new superhero struggling to control their power?

That kind of power is usually of little use as it comes on when one least expects and leaves just as it came.

This is basically how most Christians are.

Today, I will reveal one secret that will help you properly channel the power of God in you.

Power comes by faith and faith comes by hearing the truth, that is, the word of God.

However humans have trivialised words.

Movies, fictional books, jokes, social media, even the news are all built on some form of deception.

When you listen to these and they touch your emotion, you are allowing them to control you.

Indeed, you are submitting some control.

That control should be reserved for the word of God.

What should you do?

Decrease every other source of information as you increase the word of God in your life.
