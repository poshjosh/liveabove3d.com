If you think the floor is lava, when it is just wood, then your behaviour will be restricted by the lie in your mind.

You are not free; to walk around; freely.

The moment you know the truth; your behaviour will no longer be influenced by the lie.

The truth shall make you free - John Chapter 8 Verse 32.

What about faith?

Hmm.

A clay vessel placed before a light bulb will cast a shadow.

The bible says that God is the light bulb and his word is the light.

This physical world is the shadow. 

The clay vessel is spirit substance; in the fourth dimension.

Know this; the fourth dimension is more real than our physical world.

You - a shadow - will have faith when you know, that the spirit substance - that is the real substance - of what you want; exists.

How can this happen?

How can we tap into the fourth dimension?

Let me know what you think in the comments section.
