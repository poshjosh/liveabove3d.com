The particles you are made up of, weigh less than 5 percent, of your total weight.

What about the remaining 95 percent of your weight?

The remaining 95 percent comes from the energy of those same particles.

A fancy way of saying this is: “we are made of energy.”

No wonder Nikola Tesla said:

 “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.”

Unsurprisingly, thousands of years before Tesla, the Bible in Hebrews 11:3 recorded that: 

“Things which are seen were not made of things which do appear”.

It explains this by saying:

“The universe and its epochs were framed by the word of God.”

A fancy way of saying this is: “words can create matter.”

Hmm.

We don’t see people creating things with words, in our everyday life. 

So there must be something wrong with our words.

In the next part, we will discover the secret sauce of words.

BIBLE VERSES

Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

Hebrews 11:3
