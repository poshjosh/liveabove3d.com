The days of signs and wonders are near.

Thousands of years ago, signs and wonders were on display at the national and global level.

At that time, the average person knew that there is a realm beyond the physical.

This is not the case today.

Science tells us that the age of enlightenment is partly responsible for this.

The stage for enlightenment was set by the departure of Yahweh’s glory from the camp of Israel.

With that departure, the gods opposing Yahweh had their way with Israel.

Those gods are preparing humankind for one final battle against Yahweh.

Technological advancement is really in preparation for that battle.

As we have read from past stories, technology will only be a front for the real combatants – the gods.

The days leading up to the battle of the gods, will see signs and wonders return to the limelight.
