Yahweh is merciful – but.

Hmmm.

Yahweh told King Hezekiah that he would die.

On hearing this, Hezekiah wept sore for mercy.

So, God added 15 years to his life - 2 Kings 10.

Compare that with Adam and Eve.

The devil had told them:

“God knows that when you eat the forbidden fruit, you will be as gods”

So, after God confronted them for disobeying, rather than ask for mercy, they must have thought:

“I’ll take my chances – God may be hiding something” - Genesis 3:11 – 13

Are there areas in your life where you are: “taking your chances”, rather than trusting in God?

This is a call for you to – stop – accept your mistake and turn to God.

Finally, remember that mercy will always win judgement.

But there will be no mercy to those who show no mercy – James 2:13.

Do not reject any plea for mercy.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSES

For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.

James 2:13 (NASB 1995)

20 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,
3 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.
6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
2 Kings 10:1 - 6

11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
Genesis 3:11 – 13
