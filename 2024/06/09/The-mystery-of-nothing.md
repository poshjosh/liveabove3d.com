Does nothing exist?

Hmmmmm.

The universe - appeared from nothing.

Particles - often appear from nothing - at the quantum level.

Scientists agree that we cannot see a four-dimensional body.

Rather we would see a 3D projection of the 4D body – appear from nothing.

It is possible then, that the “nothing”, which makes “something”, is four-dimensional.

If so, everything that appears from nothing (including the universe), are projections from the fourth dimension.

Hmmmmm.

A thing is more real than its projection.

For example, we are more real than our shadows.

Even so, the 4D nothing which created (or rather projected) the universe is more real than the universe.

Even though it is more real, it is nothing, because it cannot be measured or observed in the physical world.

For the record – “The universe, ages were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.” – Hebrews 11:3

BIBLE VERSES

Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

Hebrews 11:3
