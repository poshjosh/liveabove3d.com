People rarely ask the right questions.

A very evil man leaves you a billion-dollar inheritance but asks you to do good with it. 

Would you accept?

I for one, began to think of reasons not to accept the offer.

Reason Number One – The relative who left the inheritance was evil.

Reason Number Two – I know others who received such an inheritance, and I don’t want to end up like them.

Reason Number Three – There must be foul play involved.

Hmmm.

Know this.

Reason number one is why most atheists reject Christianity.

Reason number two is why most undecided people reject Christianity.

Reason number three is why most Muslims reject Christianity.

However, only one reason makes sense, and it is this:

“What strings are attached to my accepting this inheritance”

I asked and I was told that I had to submit to one simple code of conduct:

“Love others”

Is this what you think - about Christianity?

If not, ask the right people - the right questions.

Start today.

Shalom.
