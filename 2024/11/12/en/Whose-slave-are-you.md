The whole world,

is asking,

for your response.

Hmmm.

If you canâ€™t control your response when someone hurts you,

how will you be able to control your response in the face of death?

If you are always responding to the world around you,

how will you be able to respond to the Word of God, if faced by serious illness?

Hmmm.

Remember - you are slaves to whom you respond to.

Knowing this, always subject the information you receive from the world, to the Word of God.

Do this always - whether there is trouble or not.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSES

Do you not know that when you go on presenting yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?

Romans 6:16 (LSB)B)
