I want you to wake up smiling.

I want you to go through life laughing.

I want your joy to remain, even when troubles call.

So that your joy may be complete, 

I AM - glad to answer your prayers.

What makes you think I hold back?
 
Do you give your child a stone, when they ask for bread?

If evil men, know how to give good gifts, to their children, 

how much more will I give you what you ask?

If I did not spare my son (Jesus) - but delivered him up for you; 

how will I not also with Him, freely give you all things?

Hear me.

Ask in the name of Jesus

And you will receive.

So that your joy, may be complete.

BIBLE VERSES

For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares Yahweh, ‘plans for peace and not for calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

Jeremiah 29:11 (LSB)

For in the day of calamity He will conceal me in His shelter;
In the secret place of His tent He will hide me;
He will lift me up on a rock.

And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,
And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with loud shouts of joy;
I will sing, and I will sing praises to Yahweh.
Psalm 25:5-6 (LSB)

for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Romans 14:17 (LSB)

Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!

Matthew 7:9-11 (LSB)

He who indeed did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?
