We set our thermostat to the temperature we want. 

If the temperature is 5 degrees and we want it to be 20 degrees, 

we set our thermostat to 20 degrees, not 5 degrees.

Hmmm.

Wait, listen and determine once and for all,

that when you are prayed for, you will be healed.

For that is the Word of God.

After you have been prayed for, 

no matter what happens, keep saying what you want to see. 

It could seem strange to speak about receiving strength when one is weak. 

However, it is better to speak of strength, 

as speaking of weakness can never bring strength.

So, surround yourself with only those who speak strength.

Finally, if you feel weak, ask God to strengthen your faith, 

before asking him to strengthen your body.

With weak faith, you may lose any strength you receive.

With strong faith, you will keep any strength you receive.

Hmmm.

Share this with someone who needs to know.

BIBLE VERSES

If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man

Though the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it boasts of great things.

For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the entire body as well. Now if we put the bits into the horses’ mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well. Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wills. So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.

James 3:2-5 (LSB)

Don’t use your tongue to agree with God today 
But contradict God tomorrow.
It should not be used that way.

With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God. 10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.

James 3:9-10 (LSB)

Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
Those who enjoy using it, will face the consequences.

Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
And those who love it will eat its fruit.

Proverbs 18:21 (LSB)its fruit.
