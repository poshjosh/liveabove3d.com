Here is a riddle.

Demons, unbelievers, a believer and a new convert all pray to Jesus.

Whose prayer did not get answered?

You’ll be surprised - so, stick around to find out.

Jesus was walking on water.

Peter - a believer - asked Jesus to call him.

Jesus could have said, “you are not ready for this kind of power”.

Rather, Jesus answered: “come”.

Later, demons asked Jesus to send them away.

Jesus could have said, “No”.

Rather, Jesus answered: “go”.

This angered the unbelieving residents of the city, who asked Jesus to leave.

Jesus could have insisted that he had to do God’s work.

Rather, Jesus left the city.

Before Jesus left the city, the man from whom the demons were cast (now a new convert) asked to follow him.

Surprisingly, Jesus answered: “Return to your house and recount the great things God has done for you”.

You see, God’s response is not based on how sinless you are.

It is based on whether your request is lawful.

Share this with someone who needs this revelation.
