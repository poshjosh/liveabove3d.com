Why is AI the perfect platform - to rule the world?

Here we go.

The former angel of light – also known as Lucifer – wants to be like God.

Enjoying total loyalty (or worship).

Through the centuries Lucifer used platforms (for example statues) to influence (or rule) the world.

People worshiped kings; kings worshiped gods through statues.

As knowledge increased, humans began to shift their loyalty to – science.

With science, power came through knowledge, not kings or gods. 

Yet science is leading us to create a new platform – AI.

One day, anyone who controls a super intelligent AI, will control:

All nuclear missiles, all modern weapons, all modern power plants, all modern equipment.

No platform, no statue, no god, of the past offered such a widespread influence.

One day, AI will offer such influence.

What do you think, Lucifer will do?

Let me know in the comments section.

Shalom.
