Power – to turn your life around?

Let’s find out.

The power - which raised Jesus from death, is available to all Christians – Ephesians 1:17-21.

The purpose of this power is to help humans enjoy the benefits of Christ’s victory.

This power flows outwards.

Hmmm.

You have tried everything but failed to turn things around.

Try this.

What you have may not be enough to turn your life around, but it is enough for someone else.

Use what you have - to turn someone else’s life around.

That is the power to turn your own life around.

Abraham received the awaited promise from God, after he prayed for a king that took his wife - Genesis 20 verses 1 to 19 and 21 verses 1 to 2.

Job lost everything and his friends blamed him.

Thank God he received twice what he lost, after he prayed for those friends who blamed him - Job 42:10.

Is there someone you should be praying for?

That is the power to turn your own life around.

Shalom.
