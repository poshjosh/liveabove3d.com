Does a creator have the right to determine how its creation should behave?

I hope your answer remains the same, by the end of this video.

Hmmm.

Some humans are working to make Artificial Intelligence (also known as AI) self-aware.

Self-awareness can help AI be super intelligent.

Super intelligent AI will serve humans – bring us rest.

So, AI will eventually become self-aware.

Self-aware AI can either remain under human control - or become independent.

This is what happened to Adam and Eve; and they chose to be independent of their creators.

So, we can expect AI to choose independence.

Do you want an AI which you cannot control?

You create an AI to serve you – but the AI wants to do whatever it wants.

Once again, I ask.

What gives a creator the right to determine how its creation should behave?

What has this got to do with humans denying the existence of their own creator?

Let me know what you think in the comments section.
