What do you do when everything goes haywire?

Some cry out to their father for help.

This is OK.

However, the one who has been drinking the glory of Christ will say:

“My father knows about this”.

“This is for my father’s glory”.

“I will continue to glorify Jesus no matter what”.

“I bless those who have treated me horribly”.

“Is my father worried about anything?”

“Who does not know that I imitate my Father who is in heaven?”

Hmmm

To be like the Father, we must not be moved by troubles.

To not be moved by troubles, we must be dead to the cares of this world.

To die to this world, we must be drunk with the glory of Christ.

Pray with me.

“Dear Father, I relied on my strength – that is past”.

“Now I rise, with the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit”.

“I go forth and I possess - for your kingdom”.

“In Jesus’ Name – Amen”.
