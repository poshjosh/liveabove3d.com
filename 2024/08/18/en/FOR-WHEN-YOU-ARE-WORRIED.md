When a prey is afraid it runs.

When a predator is afraid, it lashes out.

When a human is afraid –

What do you do when you are afraid?

What if the issue, is something you should be worried about?

I mean, shouldn’t you worry about the warming of the earth?

Shouldn’t you worry about immigrants flooding into your country?

Remember (the wonderful counsellor) Jesus?

He does not want us to worry about anything.

Jesus said: “Do not worry.” 

Don’t even worry about what to eat or wear.

If God takes care of the grass and the birds, how much more will he take care of you.

Are you not more valuable than the birds?

Which of you, by worrying, can add a single cubit to your height – or moment to your life?

Be assured, that your heavenly father knows what you need. - Mathew 6 from verse 25.

Hmmm.

Stop worrying, so that God’s ever present help, will get through to you.

Shalom.
