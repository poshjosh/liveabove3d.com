Have you tried everything to change your situation, without success?

Here is a simple way out – it’ll surprise you.

Hmmm.

Remember Abraham? 

God promised him a son.

Abraham reminded God a few times and each time God repeated his promise.

Then, one day, a King took Abraham’s wife.

God appeared to the King and told him to return Abraham’s wife.

Then Abraham prayed for the King. 

After Abraham prayed the for King, God visited Sarah, and she conceived - Genesis 20 verses 1 to 19 and 21 verses 1 to 2.

We also have Job to learn from.

Job lost his sheep, servants and 10 children – everything but his wife.

Job’s wife urged him to denounce God, give up and die.

Job’s friends blamed Job for his losses.

Despite this, Job prayed for his friends.

After Job prayed for his friends - The Lord rescued Job and gave him twice as much as he had before - Job 42 verse 10.

Now I ask you.

Is there someone you should be praying for?

Shalom.
