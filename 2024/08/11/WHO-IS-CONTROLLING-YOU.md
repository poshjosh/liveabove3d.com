Who is controlling you?

God asked Adam a question in the garden of Eden: “Who told you?” - Genesis 3 verse 11.

Here we go. 

Who told you that your prayer is not answered because you are not righteous.

Definitely not the Bible which says that “those who have faith in Jesus Christ are the display of God’s righteousness” – Romans 3 verses 21 and 22.

Also, who told you that your prayers are not answered?

Who told you that your sickness is getting worse.

Definitely not the Bible, which says that “with the wounds of Jesus, you are healed” – Isaiah 53 verse 5.

Remember, Jesus never said no, to anyone who needed healing.

So, what makes you think your case is different?

Who told you that success is not possible. 

Definitely not the Bible which says that “whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world” – 1 John 5 verse 4.

Whatever you do – remember: “you are a slave to the one you believe; the one you obey.” – Romans 6 verse 16.

Shalom.
