You could be a zombie.

Yes.

The original meaning of a zombie is: a corpse controlled by a witch.

You may say: “I am not being controlled by a witch”.

Well, your mind makes a lot of decisions without you knowing.

Those decisions are made based, on the information - in your mind.

This means that your mind is controlled, by whoever controls that information.

Ephesians 2 verse 2 says the world is controlled by “the prince of the power of the air”.

This Prince makes people not to love others.

No wonder then, that there are good reasons not to love:

That horrible co-worker who spread those rumours about you.

Sworn enemies who want to destroy you.

Blood thirsty religious fanatics.

Pedophiles.

Hmmm.

You may say: “but I love everyone”.

Well, there is more to it than meets the eye.

Here’s an example.

A close friend treated me despitefully and caused others to persecute me.

I forgave the friend to the point that others asked me:

“Why do you still walk with this guy after all he did?”

It’s been a while now, and I often use what happened between my friend and I, to teach my kids how to behave.

However, there is one more thing I need to do:

“Pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you” – Mathew 5 verse 44.

Wow.

We often think we are living right.

However, only the Spirit of Truth can guide us to live right – John 16 verse 13

You see, when you forgive, you stop the problem from spreading.

Even better, when you pray, you can reverse the problem.

Who would have thought that there was more to do than forgiving. 

The lesson is that: it is not possible to live right without the Spirit of Truth.

A deeper lesson is that: “Many zombies don’t know they are zombies”

The way out, is to continuously renew your mind with the word of God – Romans 12 verse 2.

You also have to guard your mind diligently – Proverbs 4 verse 23.

If you don’t, you become a zombie, controlled by the Prince of the power of the air.

Shalom.
