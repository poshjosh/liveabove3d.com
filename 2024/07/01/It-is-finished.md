If God is for us, who can be against us?

God, who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him gladly and freely give us all things?

Who shall bring any charge against us, when it is God who justified us.

We are justified because the one who died (Christ Jesus) is interceeding for us.

And nothing – can stop Christ – from loving us.

Neither death nor life, 

Nor angels nor rulers

Nor things present nor things to come, 

Nor powers, 

Nor height nor depth, 

Nor anything else in all creation, 

Will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans 8 from verse 31.

The victory has been secured.

Go now - use these words - prosper!

Shalom.
