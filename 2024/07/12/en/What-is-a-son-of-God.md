Have you met - a son of God?

What exactly - is a son of God?

I thought that was what Jesus called himself - you say.

Hmmm.

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a known astrophysicist, author and science communicator.

Recently, he effectively said:

“We know that when airplanes crash, death does not discriminate between religions.”

“The satanist dies the same way as the atheist, same as the Muslim, Christian or Jew.”

“We would expect members of a true religion to survive, but this is not the case.”

Ha ha.

Reason is served.

Who shall respond?

Hmmm.

A little voice answered and said:

“Christians are those who say they are Christians.”

“God does not recognize this.”

“Rather, God recognizes believers - and this is how you know a believer.”

“Believers love God with all their heart and also their neighbors” – Matthew 22 verses 37 to 40.

“Believers heal the sick and cannot be hurt by deadly things.” - Mark 16 verses 17 and 18

“Anyone who diligently searches for believers, who walked out of death unharmed, will not only find them, but also Christ.”

“God calls believers, his sons and says that all creation is in pain, groaning for the appearance of his sons.” – Romans 8 from 19 to 22.

“Neil deGrasse Tyson has groaned” – concluded the little voice.

 “Who will respond?” – I replied.

“Sons of God respond to an earnest thirst for God” - said the little voice.

“Why would anyone who has found light in science, thirst for God?” – I asked.

“On the day of judgement, the lives of scientists who thirsted for God, will judge those who did not.” – replied the little voice.

“Why won’t God just save them.” – I asked.

To this, the little voice, responded with a story.

A woman had a pet parrot, she loved so much.

Their relationship was built on love and respect.

One day the pet parrot decided to leave her.

She pleaded with the pet to remain, but the parrot left her.

It’s been many years now and the pet parrot wants to return home.

To this, the woman replied: “Come – I am waiting with open hands”.

But the pet cried and said: “You must bring me back with your power”.

To which the woman replied: “If I had caused you to leave, then I would have to cause you to return. But you left freely, so return freely”.

“Through Adam, humankind chose to leave God”

“Through Christ – God chose to welcome back humankind”

“Since God did not force Adam to leave, he will also not force humankind to return”

“It is a legal thing” – said the little one.

“Scientists understand laws and how they are not broken - surely they will understand this” – I said.

“Will they?” – replied the little one.

Hmmm.

Be wise.

Your reasons for not believing God will not be acceptable evidence in a legal sense.

Remember, God sees everything, and he has told us that he gives everyone the required opportunity to accept him - 2 Peter 3 verse 9.

On the day of judgement, that opportunity – which you quietly overlooked - will be revealed for all to see.

Here is my advice to you, scientist.

Search for the right person; ask them sincere questions. 

Make that decision now.

The single most important decision of your life.

Shalom.
