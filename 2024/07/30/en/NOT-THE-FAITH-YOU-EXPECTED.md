Today we reveal a mystery of faith, I guarantee, you need to hear. 

You’ll be surprised.

Luke 17 from verse 12 records how Jesus healed 10 lepers.

Jesus told them to go show themselves to the priests.

As they went, they realized that they were cleansed.

Responding to the word - is faith.

So, it made sense for the lepers to (in obedience) continue to the priests.

However, one leper turned back, to thank Jesus.

Surprisingly, Jesus wondered why only one leper returned, to glorify God.

You see, faith - pleases God - but there’s more.

It is good to give, because Jesus says: give.

However, it is better to give, because (like Jesus) you are moved with compassion.

The first - is obedience.

The second - is “having the mind of Christ” – 1 Corinthians 2 verse 16.

The aim of faith is not obedience, rather that we should think like God – God is love.

No wonder it is written that: “faith works by love” – Galatians 5 verse 6.

Shalom.
