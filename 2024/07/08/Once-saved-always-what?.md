Can a Christian lose their salvation?

Let’s break that question down to three smaller questions.

Smaller questions that will make the answer clearer.

The answer to the third question has a twist, which explains why there is confusion about losing salvation.

First question - Can a Christian, who at some point in their live said the prayer of salvation, end up in hell?

Yes.

Jesus said: “I will reject many who did miracles in my name” – Mathew 7 verses 22 and 23

Anyone can say the prayer of salvation. However, only those who believe will follow Christ’s example.

Hmmm.

Second question - Can a Christian who sins, end up in hell because of their sin?

No, but -

You need to understand the relationship between salvation, sin and death (or being cut off).

Salvation covers the sins of those in Christ.

Sin when it is fully matured will cut you off from Christ. – James 1 verse 15.

Salvation does not cover those who are cut off.

You know where it is heading to, yet you start the journey because you can get off before the end – Don’t do it.

Hmmm.

Third question - Can someone who believed God and received the Holy spirit, turn around and reject God?

Yes and No.

Yes, because – we always have free will. We are free, even to reject God.

No, because – to God, a person who turns around, never believed in the first place.

Once again, I ask you.

Can a Christian lose their salvation?

Let me know what you think in the comment’s section.

Shalom.


BIBLE VERSES

Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’

And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’

Mathew 7:22 – 23

Then the evil desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully matured, brings forth death.

James 1:15 (AMPC)
