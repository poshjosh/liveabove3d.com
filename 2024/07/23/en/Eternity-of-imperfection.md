What has citizenship got to do with entropy?

And what - in John Hopkins name - is entropy?

Hmmm.

In science, entropy is a word associated with disorder.

The science of entropy tells us that things – get more disorderly – with time.

So, what happens when disorder, is allowed to continue increasing – forever?

What has all this got to do with citizenship of heaven?

Here’s what.

Disorder is another word for stains, spots or imperfection.

Stains can be transferred.

A stained document can only produce, a stained copy.

Also, if one parent is imperfect, then both parents can only produce - an imperfect baby.

This means that if we have one stained person and nine spotless persons, given enough time, we will end up with many stained persons – and zero spotless persons.

Imperfection entered the human race through Adam – Romans 5 verse 12.

From the time of Adam, the human race became increasingly evil over time. Genesis 6 verse 5.

The progress of evil was slowed, when the Holy Spirit of God started working on earth. – Acts 2 verses 1 – 4.

One day, when the Holy Spirit leaves the earth (with true believers), the full blast of accumulated evil will be unleashed. – Second Thessalonians 2 verse 7.

At that time, demons will be free to do whatever they want to humans. – Revelation 9 verses 1 to 4.

Demons are far more disorderly (or evil) than humans, because imperfection – like disorder – increases with time, and each demon has lived far longer (at least thousands of years) than each human.

Hmmm.

With our understanding of imperfection and time, we can say this.

If we have any group of people - the slightest imperfection - given enough time, will result to - hell.

Hell is simply a place where imperfection (or evil) is unimaginably high.

There’s more.

Things don’t arrange themselves.

The science of entropy also tells us that an outside force is needed to counter disorder.

For humans, that outside force is the life of God.

The Life is in the Word of God - John 1 verse 4.

The life of God is perfect.

Even more, the life of God cannot be corrupted – 1 Peter 1 verse 23.

This means that when the imperfect, willingly submits to the life of God, it becomes - perfect.

Remember, every human is already imperfect, since all humans come from one imperfect couple - and imperfection is inherited.

For this reason, the Word of God (being perfection), took the human form and lived amongst humans. John 1 verse 14.

So that all who submit, to the influence of perfection, can live forever in perfection – John 3 verses 16 and 17.

Submission, not just attention – is all you need.

Every human (of all ethnicity and beliefs) is invited to submit to the Word of God.

Any person who submits to the Word of God, becomes a citizen of Heaven - Philippians 3 verse 20.

Jesus is the Word of God.

The process of being a citizen of Jesus’ kingdom is called “Salvation”.

A person becomes a citizen of Heaven by believing and saying that Jesus is the influencer of their life – Romans 10 verse 9.

Heaven is the only country that grants all immigrants citizenship, immediately they believe and swear allegiance.

Judgement - is the separation of those who submit to perfection, from those who don’t.

This separation allows each group of beings, to enjoy the fruit of their beliefs.

The gathering of those who submit, enjoy the perfect creations of their Lord – what we call heaven.

The gathering of those who don’t submit, become increasingly more evil with time – what we call hell.

Once again.

The slightest imperfection - given eternity, will result to hell.

No wonder then that after Adam and Eve sinned, God prevented them from living forever – Genesis 3:22-23

Yet today, scientists aim to reverse aging – a shot at eternal life – without God.

Hmmm.

Does this mean that Jesus will return before man figures out eternal life through science?

Let me know what you think in the comments section.

Shalom.
