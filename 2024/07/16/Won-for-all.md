It takes looking away from Christ – to be angry.

To be sad - you have to study - the problem.

To be weak - you must have used - your own strength.

Just to be sure you know where we are heading:

It takes selfishness – to hate.

Hmmm.

Even so, you are not condemned, but invited by Yahweh to – fix your gaze.

“Fix your gaze on Jesus, the founder and perfecter of your faith”

“Who – for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame.”

“Who is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God”

“Who endured from sinners such hostility against himself”

“He did all this, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.”

Hebrews 12 verses 2 and 3.

All it takes - is Jesus.

Shalom.
