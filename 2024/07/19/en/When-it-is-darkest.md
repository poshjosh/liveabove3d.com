In the face of trouble, you run to the Word of God.

When the trouble persists, you (being mature) realize that it must be a trial.

You prepare for the long haul by making sacrifices like fasting or sowing.

When things get hotter, you are not bothered.

Rather (knowing that it is darkest before the dawn) you look forward to the darkest and hottest point. 

Then things get hotter, and hotter, and hotter.

“Surely it must be darkest now” - you think, with excitement for the dawn.

Lesson Number One - If you know it is darkest, then it is not darkest.

Then things get hotter - till you are confused.

Then hotter and hotter - till you are frustrated.

Then hotter, and hotter, and hotter - until you panic.

In panic, the problem is an unstoppable monster.

In panic, you can no longer hear the Word of God.

You always knew that God cannot forsake you, yet the words escape your lips:

“O God why have you forsaken me!”

Lesson Number Two - Such situations obscure your access to God, so that the Word of God in you - is all that you have.

Hmmm.

“There is a mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but which is now revealed to you” 

“The Word of God in you – the hope of glory”. Colossians 1 verses 26 and 27.

It’s all about the Word of God in you.

How much of God’s Word do you - really know.

For example, can you tell which of the following statements is true?

God heals us when he wants.

God heals us if we have faith.

God heals us if we have not sinned.

Which is right?

Are you sure?

Can you stand before the mirror and use the Word of God to defend your position?

Let me know what you think, in the comments section.

Shalom.
