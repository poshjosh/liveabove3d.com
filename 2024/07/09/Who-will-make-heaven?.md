It is not only Christians who will enter heaven.

Hmmm.

God tells a prophet to do something to receive a reward.

The prophet doubts, and in doubting reveals God’s instruction to a sinner.

The sinner hearing the instruction, immediately obeys.

Now I ask you.

Who shall receive the Lord’s reward?

Hmmm.

When the trumpet shall sound.

Some prophets will remain, and some sinners will be taken away.

Then the fool will say: “This must not be the trumpet of God, for we see prophets remain and sinners taken”

Do not be deceived.

Many non-Christians are obedient to the Lord in secret.

Our father who sees what is done in secret will reward them openly – Matthew 6 verse 4.

Once again.

One day in the future, millions will disappear from the earth – Matthew 24.

Many will say it is not what the bible foretold - because non-Christians also disappeared.

For those who will remain, remember what you learned today – do not be deceived.

Shalom.

BIBLE VERSES
“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
“So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
Matthew 6 verses 1 to 4 (NIV)

37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

Matthew 24:37-39.he Son of man be.

Matthew 24:37-39.
