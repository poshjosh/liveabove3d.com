Hello and welcome to LiveAbove3D.

- If God exists, why is there so much evil in the world?

- If God exists, should he not show him or herself?

- Why do I have to find God if he or she exists?

These are some of the many questions, that we will explore together. We will explore these questions, in a way that you will not find anywhere else. For example, we could prove or disprove the existence of God with logic. However, we are scientists and atheists, so – how about following the evidence.

You see - if there is a gravitational pull, there must be some mass causing it. So, God did not leave his proving - to logic. Rather he gave the evidence. No - I am not talking about the stars and the sun. Rather I am talking about a person, and No - it is not Jesus.

This is an introduction, so we will not get too far ahead. However, here is what you need to know:

The bible says that when you receive the spirit of God, you will receive the power (ability) of God. God is love, so the power is for loving the world, by taking care of the world, in a way that only its creator can. The bible also says that those who receive the spirit of God, are a new species of beings. A cross between God and man. Jesus was the first of such beings. He used the power of God to love; by healing the sick, raising the dead, freeing the oppressed and much more. There is no greater way to prove the existence of God, but by doing only what a God of love will do – miraculous acts of love.

This is the point where we lose some people. We lose people because of the following cycle, which often happens during such discussions:

1.	You say there is no God.

2.	I say that if you believe God, you will receive his power and ability to do miraculous things, to help the world.

3.	You say it’s all bullshit, because miracles do not exist.

We have a cycle, because by the third sentence, we are back to where we started i.e. you saying such things do not exist. We need to exit such cycles. Stick around - and we will break the cycle together.

Start by watching 2 of our short videos which show that the fourth dimension is more real than the third dimension.

After watching those 2 videos, you should either forget about us or let us know what you think at: live.above.3d@gmail.com
